The Family Counseling Center (FCC) was founded in 1979 by a group of concerned citizens, organized by the United Way of the CSRA, who recognized the need for professional counseling services to serve members of the community who could not afford private mental health care and did not qualify for services provided by state agencies. Since those early days FCC has been a strong partner with the United Way.  The Family Counseling Center has also maintained a close relationship with the CSRA Area Agency on Aging which has graciously given out it's Professional In-home Counseling Grant to us since 1981.  The Family Counseling Center has also partnered with various non-profit organizations from SafeHomes of Augusta, Friendship Community Center, The American Red Cross, and Child Enrichment. In 2009 the Family Counseling Center moved to it's current location in Martinez, GA to better place itself to support all of the CSRA community.  The Family Counseling Center has always maintained an identity as a Social Work mental health practice.  Our counselors have predominantly been Licensed Clinical Social Workers with a vast amounts of experience in dealing with the many struggles that individuals, couples and families deal with every day.  Currently our counselors consist of four social workers and one Licensed Professional Counselor. Our dedicated staff and counselors have always put the needs over the community first.  While our organization accepts insurance based services,  55% of our clientle live at or below the poverty line, normally having no insurance or inadequate coverage.  The majority of those receiving our non-insurance services are women, over half of which have children. These services are essential to the community and serve to shore up the already strained mental health resources of our community.";"Keeping Family Relationships Intact; Assisting Clients In Using Healthy Interventions In Parenting; Helping Clients Choose Life Over Suicide, and Avoiding Institutionalization; Facilitating A Sense Of Independence In Clients; Aiding Clients In Their Personal Lives Including Graduating School And Gaining And/Or Maintaining Meaningful Employment; Developing Support Systems; Helping Our Clients Stop The Cycle Of Abuse And Addiction Within Their Families";

Children and their caregivers will have an opportunity to tell their story and talk about their strengths and needs with Hillside’s Connections staff.

Once the children are in the Connections Program they will have an opportunity to visit with the chosen family and develop a relationship during a pre-placement process to determine if the child and family are a good match for each other. A team is developed to monitor the success of the placement, also a specific staff will work with them on skills needed to regulate emotions, crisis intervention skills, and develop independent living skills. Community based mental health agencies will be targeted to address therapeutic needs for emotional and behavioral problems. Also staff will advocate for any educational needs and develop a plan for success towards completion of high school.

The greatest effort spent on each couple will be the home study. A home study is a series of interviews in which the social worker concentrates on collecting information via face-to-face contact with each couple. The home study typically consists of an orientation interview followed by 4 home study interviews. 1. The first interview is a home visit in which the social worker will address each of the qualifications for adoption. This is a joint interview. 2. The next visits are individual interviews and are typically held at the LCS office. Both spouses may come on the same day, if they must travel to get to the office. If they are local, each spouse may schedule his or her own interview at his convenience. The interviews will be autobiographical in nature and will be based on an Autobiography written by the applicant. The social worker will ask that you complete this Autobiography prior to this interview. 3. The third interview will focus on parenting philosophies and plans. Issues such as experience and exposure to children, the applicants’ parenting received when they were children, values and discipline will be explored. 4. The fourth interview will focus on adoption education. We will discuss how to educate the child on his or her adoptive status, how to educate others, proper words and timing, books on adoption, trans-racial adoptions, contact with birth parents, background information on any prospective adopted child, completing a profile and many other issues common to adoption. Education is a very important part of the home study process. Each family in the domestic program is required to attend Lifeline’s domestic adoption conference in Birmingham, Alabama. This conference is a two day interactive training which will prepare and equip families for the joys and challenges of domestic adoption. After the home study process is completed, families will begin the matching process. Each family will create a family profile. Family profile’s are shown based on the birth mother’s preferences. Lifeline requires that at a minimum adoptive couples be willing to meet the birth mother before the adoption takes place, and to send correspondence through Lifeline to the birth family after the placement."

APPLICATION: You will receive a response within one week of your application. ACTIVE STATUS: Once you are accepted into a program, we help you find a child based on your requests. Do you envision an open adoption, a semi-open adoption or a closed adoption? We can help you make the best choice for you. HOME STUDY: A caseworker is assigned to complete a home study, in compliance with Georgia law. LIFE BOOKS: You create a ""Life Book"" giving birth mothers a glimpse of your family, home and heart for the child through some friendly photos. MATCHING: Once you are in the program and your Life Book is received, birth mothers are able to select you, or sometimes we will match a child to a family for the birth mother, if she requests it. MEETING THE BIRTH MOTHER: If appropriate, you will have the chance to meet the birth mother and spend some time with her. Sometimes, you may be present for the birth, sometimes not. SIGNING SURRENDERS: Once the baby is born, the birth mother signs a document surrendering her parental rights. According to Georgia law, she has ten days to change her mind. This is called the Revocation Period. If she does, the baby will be returned to her. If we feel that a placement is ""high-risk"", you may choose to place the baby in a wonderful caring home until the 10-day period has passed. You should also know that it is typical in the United States for 1/3 of adopting couples to experience at least one revocation. This is often a very difficult experience, and our heart is to help you with the support you need as you ultimately journey to the child God has for you. FINALIZATION: This usually occurs three to six months after placement. COMMUNICATION: Our Agency provides birth mothers with monthly updates of the child for the first six months and yearly updates for every year after until the child is 21. An Open Door works with a limited number of families. Usually, the waiting period is six months to one year to be matched. International Adoptions Process: PHONE CALL: When you call, our adoption consultants will help you decide if applying is right for you. APPLICATION: Upon receipt of your application our director will review it and ensure that the country program you have requested is a good fit for your family. You will receive a response about your approval within one week of your application’s receipt at our office. Upon approval, we will send you additional paperwork which provides more information about international adoption. FINDING YOUR CHILD: WAITING LISTS & HOSTING: Once you have been accepted into the program, you might be able to begin looking at waiting children’s lists, if this is how your country program operates. Alternately, if you have hosted a child you now wish to adopt, you might already have a chid in mind. Each country will operate slightly differently in terms of this process. PARENT TRAINING: The Hague Convention requires 10 hours of parental training. An Open Door assists families with obtaining training. The training helps prepare you to parent a child who is learning a new language, culture and family. HOME STUDY: All adoptions require a home study. If you live in the state of Georgia, An Open Door caseworker is able to provide the home study for your family. If you live outside of Georgia you will need an agency located in your state for the home study. We can help suggest possible agencies in your state of residence if needed. USCIS APPROVAL: Once your home study is complete you will submit the appropriate immigration form for your country program in order to be approved by United States Immigration Services as an international adoptive couple. DOSSIER: Once finished with your home study packet and while you are waiting for your USCIS approval, you will be preparing dossier paperwork according to your country program’s requirements. Your adoption consultant will help you through this process, creating the dossier packet with your information inserted into the documents, offering guidance and tips on completing the information, and reviewing the information to make sure it is correctly completed. APPLYING WITH THE FOREIGN COUNTRY: Once your dossier is ready, it is sent to the foreign country and is translated and then submitted for approval by that government. Once you are approved, you can take the next steps to adopt your child. In some countries this means moving forward to travel for your first trip, in other countries this means requesting a child from a waiting child list, and in other situations you may begin a wait period to be matched with a child by the foreign government. Speak with your adoption consultant to understand which situation applies to you. CHILD'S MEDICAL RECORDS: Once you are matched with a child by the foreign country, you will receive your child’s medical records to review. Adoptive parents will review the referral information, seek a medical opinion if desired, and accept or deny the referral. TRAVEL: The travel process can vary greatly from one country to the next. Speak with your adoption consultant about how this works in your country, including the overall time frame, time in country, and number of trips to the country required. During the travel process you will be meeting with the foreign adoption authority, meeting your child, and initializing the court process. FINALIZATION: The adoption is finalized in the foreign court. After the court hearing you will process through other in country paperwork, including getting a new birth certificate for your child, a new passport, and then applying with the US Embassy for a Visa. VISA: Your final step before coming home with your child is to apply for and receive a Visa for your child to enter into the US. You will complete certain paperwork in advance in order to apply for the visa, as well as visiting a medical doctor for an evaluation of your child by a doctor appointed by the Embassy. WELCOME HOME: When you come home with your child you both will encounter a tremendous number of changes. These can include learning English, adjusting to a new culture and making new friends. And even more importantly this means getting to know each other as parent and child, and attaching and bonding to each other. There are many resources available both pre and post adoption which can better help you to know what to expect. An Open Door works with a limited number of countries. The overall time frame can vary tremendously from one country to the next. Some adoptions might take as little as 6-9 months while others from countries with a longer wait time might take several years."

AmericanKidz offers a full complement of legal, educational and counseling services to help you navigate the process. The first step will be an office consultation with one of our staff during which we will begin to get to know one another. You will have the chance to explain your current family dynamic and how you see it changing. Once retained, we will go to work for you. We will provide you with the tools you need to craft your adoption plan. Whether you wish to adopt an infant through a private adoption or adopt an older child through the foster care system we will be there to help you every step of the way. The first step is to obtain a favorable home study. If you reside within the same geographic area of either of our offices a member of our professional staff will complete your required home study. If you live outside of this area we will assist you in retaining a licensed social worker or agency to perform your home study for you. During your home study, a social worker will visit your home and meet all members of your household. Our goal is to assist you in finding a child who will complement your family and adjust to your lifestyle. You will be required to submit to a criminal and abuse registry background check. You will be asked to provide personal and professional references and visit your doctor for a check up. (The whole process, although very thorough, sounds much worse than it actually is). The educational component of your home study provides you with a broad overview of the children who are available for adoption and helps you understand their medical, psychological, developmental, and educational needs. At the conclusion of this process, you will come away with a detailed, narrative that advocates for your family and opens the door of your home to the right child who best compliments your own personal parenting style. Once a match is made, our social workers will take a personal interest in your birth mother. We will assist her in making doctor appointments, and in most instances attend these apointments with her. We request copies of all medical records and provide these records to you. We will help her to sort through her feelings. We help her set new goals and provide assistance with educational and vocational training. We conduct random drug testing to assure that she is taking proper care of herself and the unborn child. We help her find affordable housing and provide referals for community resources. We are there for her and for you for as long as needed. We also coordinate and attend meetings and telephone calls between you and your birth mother when appropriate and work with both you and your birth mother to craft a hospital plan that takes into consideration the feelings and emotional needs of all involved. Our staff attorney provides all adoption-related legal services, at no additional charge including personal representation at all court appearances. After placement, we will make visits to your home to evaluate how well you and your new child are adjusting to eachother. We will provide all required documentation of the adjustment process for the child’s state of origin. Furthermore, we will facilitate and coordinate necessary community resources to provide you with any needed support during the adjustment period. AmericanKidz will walk with you through the entire adoption process, and advocate for you at every turn. "

Begin Your Home Study. Click to view the domestic Home Study process. 2. Make an appointment for a consult to learn more about Adopt International’s Domestic Adoption Program. 3.

Post Placement Supervision meetings with your Adopt International Social Worker. 10. Make a court date to finalize your domestic adoption. International adoption is a wonderful way to incorporate cultural awareness and help a child who needs a family. The process varies in time and expenses, depending upon the country that you select. Here are the steps: 1. Understand the rules. The process differs if you are adopting from a Hague or non-Hague country. Our staff can assist you in understanding the regulations. 2. Complete an Adoption Home Study. The Home Study agency that you choose to work with should be a place where you have confidence in their expertise and services. 3. Hire a placing agency. Your Home Study agency may be your Placement Agency, or you may choose another agency that identifies your child and helps complete your adoption in the foreign country. 4. Obtain Immigration Pre-approval Make an application to the United States Citizenship and Immigration Service (USCIS). If you are adopting from a Hague Country, you will be filing an I-800A; if you are adopting from a non-Hague Country, you will be filing an I-600A. 5. Prepare your dossier. Every country has a list of documents required when making an application; this may go to a central authority, the attorney or court. The list must be provided by the placement entity, the organization working in or with the foreign country. 6. Receive a child referral or assignment. The agency with whom you are working will identify a child that matches the request that you have made. 7. Child Acceptance. Families review the information with medical professionals so that they make an informed decision before they sign their acceptance. It is important never to accept a referral that you believe is not right for you, and we will advocate for you. The child’s needs should always be the priority. 8. Pre-placement and Placement Travel. Some countries may require visits to the country prior to placement. 9. Complete Post Placement Supervision. State law requires that you have meetings with a social worker after your child is in your home. We take this opportunity to provide support, education and guidance in making your child’s transition and attachment as healthy as possible. 10. Finalize or Readopt. We will walk you through how to file the right court documents so that you can receive your final Adoption Decree and a new birth certificate that reflects you as the parent/s. Although readoption is not required in our state, it is the easiest way for families to obtain a US birth certificate. 11. Post Adoption Support for Adoptees and Adoptive Families. ADOPT believes that adoption is a life long issue, and we will support you whenever an adoption issue arises."

All adoptions require a family to participate in the home study assessment process, licensure process, and meet training requirements set forth by the state of Illinois. 2.Applicants must initially and continually pass clearances for the FBI, criminal activity (LEADS), and child abuse/neglect (CANTS). 3.The home study is an assessment process legally required for all non-related adoptions. It will: A. Examine the appropriateness of the home and family for adoption. B. Examine individual and family values, expectations, parenting talents and skills necessary for adoption. C. Assess whether or not adoption is appropriate for the client(s) D. Assess individual maturity and the stability of marriage/civil union relationship. E. Identify areas of strength and weakness in order to prepare for adoption challenge. 4.The home study process involves the completion of self-study documents, individual/couple interviews, and the administering of an ENRICH (marital assessment) and/or MMPI (personality inventory) involving a feedback session with a licensed counselor. 5.You will be asked to write a one page “Dear Birthparent” letter about your family and provide an Agency approved family picture. Several copies of these may be required and you may be asked to update them on a regular basis. Your letter and family picture along with others are compiled into a binder and presented to birthparents who are considering a plan of adoption for their child. 6. An adoption attorney will be needed for the adoption process. The cost is not included in your Agency adoption fees. The Agency can provide you with a list of state approved attorneys with adoption experience. We strongly encourage you to choose an experienced adoption attorney as not doing so can significantly delay your adoption process and put your adoption at legal risk. Don’t forget to give your attorney’s contact information to your Adoption Specialist. 7. Because the Birthparent(s) view and select the family they feel is the best match for them, your wait time cannot be predicted. 8.Once selected by the Birthparent(s) as a potential match, you may participate in an initial match meeting and ongoing meetings to determine compatibility. The Agency will assist you in developing an agreement about the type of ongoing communication and level of openness that you both expect from your growing relationship. 9. If the Agency works with birthparents who decide they do not want the option of selecting the Adoptive Family the agency makes every effort to match a child according to the expressed wishes of the birth parents, and the best interest of the child. This may include taking into account such things as religion, culture, race, or ethnic identity issues. If birthparents decide that they have no preference involving placement, the agency will contact the adoptive family that has been waiting the longest period of time. If a match cannot be easily made within the Agency service area, the child will be referred to another licensed or certified agency in order to avoid a delay in placement. This is completed within the parameters of Illinois law. 10. Seventy-two hours after delivery, the birthparents may sign their irrevocable and voluntary surrenders depending on their individual situation. Until these papers are signed, the Birthparent(s) can change their mind. The child may be placed with you anytime after leaving the hospital depending on the agreement and understanding of the legal issues involved. Your Adoption Specialist will explain in detail the many possibilities of placement. Your Specialist will also help you decide which is best for you. 11. After placement you will contact your attorney as soon as possible to have her or him file a Petition to Adopt. You will also contact your pediatrician for the initial visit with the child.12. After placement, your Adoption Specialist will be visiting with you and your child within the first two weeks of placement and every 30 days after for a minimum of six months. These post-placement visits are your time to express any ongoing or new concerns you have about parenting, adoption, or birthparent issues. 13. Pending Consent to Adoption by our Agency, seven to nine months after placement, your attorney will set a court date at which the final legal process will occur."

This is accomplished by a series of steps that are needed in order to insure that the home is a safe environment and that the couple is a suitable provider for a potential placement of a child. They need to be fingerprinted both through the State and the FBI. They need to have training, medical exams, provide verification of marriage, birth, education, financial stability, and of course need to have a trained social worker to in depth interviews of both the husband and wife to conduct a home study. When all is cleared and the determination is made that the couple are suitable candidates for adoption the home is licensed through the State. Adoptive couples licensed through ABCare carefully prepared and screened for the adoption process. Adoption is not an easy path for the adoptive couple. They are prepared for the rough spots and are encouraged to keep trying even when failure is encountered. They are instructed on how to best prepare the Life Book or photo album of their lives together, home, family, friends, and pet to attract the eye of a biological parent. They are encouraged to write a sincere and heartfelt letter of introduction along with the book so that they can be attractive to a potential birth mother. When selected adoptive couples are introduced to the biological parent(s) so that there is bonding and communication established between the two parties. This is a very important step in the adoption process as it is at that juncture that the final outcome of the adoption is usually determined. It is here that a comfort level is achieved, an understanding of how the child will be reared and what type of characters the adoptive couple portray. The biological parent sees that there will be stability, love and total devotion to the child by the adoptive couple. The adoptive couple makes promises of contact, pictures and updates on the child to the biological parents that are expected to be upheld. Open adoption is an option if that is desired by both parties. Some biological mothers for reasons that they alone know do not wish to have interaction for both parties, however we honor the wishes of the biological parent. The adoptive couple sends letters and pictures to the agency and these are kept in the file of the birthmother in case she wishes to have them in the future."

At this initial meeting, a counselor also will give you a St. Mary's Services' application packet. Complete An Application: Should you choose to work with St. Mary's for your adoption, the next step is to complete the application packet in its entirety. Upon receipt of your application and payment, St. Mary's staff will notify you of your acceptance for a home study in the Domestic Adoption Program. You will be assigned an adoption counselor who will remain with you during your entire adoption journey. Complete The Home Study Process: Families who are looking to adopt in Illinois are required to complete a home study. A home study is a series of interviews that you and your spouse will undergo with a licensed counselor. During these interviews, your counselor will learn more about your family and preferences in an adoption. The home study also requires for you to submit character references, undergo criminal background checks, obtain medical evaluations and receive education on parenting and adoption. Once your home study is completed, your counselor will assist you in completing a profile that will be presented to birth families who are considering adoption for their unborn baby. Prepare For Placement: This is a good time for you to continue your education on adoption and parenting. Your adoption journey begins when a child enters your home. Therefore, St. Mary's stresses the importance of adoptive families continuing to obtain education throughout the different developmental stages of their child's life. Post Placement: Domestic adoption requires monthly post placement visits with your caseworker. You also will be required to attend the monthly Parent Support Group meeting. Following the completion of the post placement supervision, your counselor will complete and submit an Investigatory Report to the court recommending your adoption be finalized."

That’s why Ada S. McKinley’s Foster Care Services Division is there to provide comprehensive support and ease the anxiety associated with the traumatic situation of a family disruption. Ada S. McKinley is currently assisting 148 children from infancy to age 21 in their search for a permanent home. Our approach keeps siblings together so they have the support, comfort, and opportunity to share their experience of family life and loss and to maintain their identity as a family unit.  A team comprised of a foster parent, social worker, and home development specialist facilitates a safe transition to a foster home placement. In many instances children may be placed with foster parents who are related. Foster parents ensure that the child’s primary needs are met, including food, clothing, personal self-care, and emotional support and comfort. Ada S. McKinley provides counseling, parenting education, and support to aid adoption by either new prospective parents or current foster parents or reunification with extended family. With the dedicated assistance of the Foster Care specialists, children and families are enabled to heal from past trauma and build stable, nurturing home environments.

We provide comprehensive adoption services and counseling to birth parents and adoptive parents. Our experienced adoption counselors are highly skilled, caring professionals, dedicated to helping birth parents and adoptive families get the guidance and support they need throughout the adoption journey. The agency was founded in 1996 by Tobi Ehrenpreis and Maggie Gill Benz.  Both licensed social workers and adoptive mothers, Tobi and Maggie combined their administrative and clinical expertise to establish the Adoption Center for Family Building.  ACFB was designed as an alternative to the more ""traditional"" adoption agencies.   Having both gone through fertility treatments and the adoption process individually with their spouses, they encountered barriers to adoption and believed that a more progressive agency would better serve the needs of birth parents and adoptive families. Since it's beginning, the Adoption Center for Family Building has grown steadily. In 1998, the agency was licensed in Indiana and opened an office in Merrillville.  Over the years, we have conducted more than 1,200 home studies for domestic and international adoptions, provided professional counseling and support to more than 1,500 expectant mothers and birth fathers, and placed about 800 infants for adoption. Today, our team of professionals is comprised of several adoption counselors, an office manager, and an administrative assistant - many who have had a personal experience with adoption. The agency also has an all-volunteer board of directors including a clinical psychologist, attorneys, other business professionals and adoptive parents.

In order to remain faithful to our mission, Catholic Charities is guided by these core values: Respect, Compassion, Competence and Stewardship. Our mission and values are based on the firm foundation of Catholic Social Teaching, a collection of themes developed in papal and other writings over the course of the Church’s history. These themes include the belief that human life is sacred; that all humans have inherent dignity, rights and responsibilities; that social structures like marriage and the family must be supported; that the needs of the poor and vulnerable must be met; and that we must be responsible stewards of God’s creation. Far from limiting our focus, our Catholic identity and values enable us to truly be “universal,” which is what “catholic” really means. The tenets of Catholic Social Teaching call us to serve everyone, regardless of their belief or background, and to employ anyone, not just Catholics, who commits to our mission. Christ reached out to people of all faiths, and Catholic Charities does the same, with the goal of transforming lives for the better.";"Adoption Services: Domestic Adoption Program, Intercountry Adoption; Post Adoption Services; Adoption/Guardianship Respite Services; Adoption/Subsidized Guardianship Preservation Services; Maternity/Pregnancy Support Services ";

Another of Child Link’s primary directives is to secure permanent homes for orphaned and abandoned children (from birth on) through our foster-to-adopt program. Annually, we place ten to fifteen children in foster-to-adopt homes with concurrent planning. We coordinate no fee adoptions to prospective parents following state mandated background checks and home studies. Before commencing adoption proceedings, Child Link works to investigate the child’s status regarding family placement options to ensure there are no unplanned disruptions in the future. Our success rate remains exceptionally high due to our diligence and expertise with fostering and adoption programs. Child Link’s adoption services are extremely thorough. As important as it is for us to place one of our youngsters in a nice home with a loving and adoring family, we want to make sure each of our youths are placed in the best possible family living situation that enables the proper nourishment to grow and mature. We want to be positive that the willing adoptive family is matched with an adolescent who best fits their living environment. The Child Link family believes there is a direct link between our extensive adoption program and our high success rate in placing orphaned youths with families. Because we have grown to love and care for the abandoned kids in our adoption program, we will always maintain a high level of foster service.

A postcard addressed to a friend is the only remaining record of Hephzibah’s beginnings. It reads, “I have begun my work. I have two boys, ages six and seven.” Later, when a local orphanage was destroyed by fire, Mary took in more than a dozen orphans and made it her mission to care for “society’s most vulnerable children.” With Mary, these children found safety, sustenance, comfort and love. She called the fledgling children’s home Hephzibah, after her mother. The name, which means “comforting mother” in Hebrew, was a perfect expression of Mary’s founding mission to create a nurturing haven for children in need. Today, more than a century later, Hephzibah’s mission is a multifaceted one. We offer short- and long-term group homes for children traumatized by neglect and abuse, child welfare and family services, foster care and adoption programs and award-winning day care on a sliding scale for families of all income levels. Our internationally recognized children’s home is built in the shape of the letter H, which stands for healing, hope, happiness and, of course, Hephzibah! Sometimes, helping a child means finding a loving, caring and safe environment outside of the home. When this is the case, our award-winning Foster Care Program ensures that there are licensed family homes, on a temporary basis, for children in crisis. Our dedicated foster parents are specially trained to provide the love, constancy and support needed to help neglected and abused children heal and learn to trust again. Sometimes foster care is a temporary arrangement while parents and children receive the counseling, services and support they need to succeed as a family unit. When returning home to their biological parents isn’t an option, many of the children in our Foster Care Program form permanent families with their foster parents through Hephzibah adoptions.";"Foster Care and Adoption Services; Group Homes; Family Services; Day Care; Educational Enrichment; Sibling Camp; Hephzibah Head Start";

The nursery also enables The Cradle to place infants whose special medical needs may mean that it takes a bit longer to find them a home that is prepared to help them thrive.  We are committed to finding a loving home for every child entrusted to our care. In recent years, The Cradle has expanded our scope to include Adoption Learning Partners (ALP), online training for prospective adoptive parents and adoption professionals. Through the power of the internet, ALP has made The Cradle's thorough training convenient and accessible to professionals and families all across the globe. The Cradle connects Cradle friends and families through Facebook and Twitter.

Things like getting to meet her daughter’s birth mom, being in labor and delivery, sharing pictures and letters over the years, visiting and having medical and background information on Lauren as she raised her. Julie hoped to help adoptive couples put themselves in a birth mother’s shoes and feel the power of the decision she was considering. She also wanted birth mothers to put themselves in the adoptive couple’s shoes, and understand how hard it was to give their hearts to a birth mom with the hopes she would choose them as parents for her baby.

Catholic Charities is committed to finding the best possible adoptive families for infants whose birth parents have chosen adoption. Counseling is available for adoptees, birth mothers, and families. The agency offers a number of services to people planning to build their families through the adoption process. The philosophy of the agency’s Infant Adoption Program is one of openness, which allows birth parents to play a major role in the selection of the adoptive family and promotes ongoing contact with the adoptive family if all agree and participate as agreed.

ACFB was designed as an alternative to the more ""traditional"" adoption agencies.   Having both gone through fertility treatments and the adoption process individually with their spouses, they encountered barriers to adoption and believed that a more progressive agency would better serve the needs of birth parents and adoptive families. Since it's beginning, the Adoption Center for Family Building has grown steadily. In 1998, the agency was licensed in Indiana and opened an office in Merrillville.  Over the years, we have conducted more than 1,200 home studies for domestic and international adoptions, provided professional counseling and support to more than 1,500 expectant mothers and birth fathers, and placed about 800 infants for adoption.

Albion, Indiana is within 35 miles of Fort Wayne, Indiana, the second largest city in the state.  Albion is a small, quaint town which also happens to be the county seat for Noble County, Indiana.  So when families finalize their adoptions, they just walk across the street to our stately courthouse built in the 1880’s.  Our office is in the lower level of St. Mark’s Lutheran Church.  The church graciously gives us office space and plenty of extra space for adoption classes, orientations, and meetings with prospective families (who can bring their other children along because there is a nursery right outside the office where the children can play.)   Albion, Indiana is also home to Chain O Lakes State Park (one of the finest in the state) and Black Pine Animal Park (a sanctuary for wild animals).  Directly across the street from our office is the Brick Ark Inn, a fine bed and breakfast which several adoptive families have stayed at when they have come to Albion for a Hand In Hand event.";"International Adoption Placement and Homestudy Services";"Step 1: If you reside in one of the states in which Hand In Hand has licensed offices (Arizona, Colorado, Florida, Indiana, or Minnesota) we invite you to attend a free orientation hosted by Hand In Hand. Our orientation sites, dates and times are listed on our news page, or you may contact the office nearest you for more information. If you reside in another state, you may request an information packet or contact our administrative office in Tucson, Arizona, and you will work directly with the Hand In Hand Program Director for your desired country. Step 2: If you choose to adopt through Hand In Hand, you must submit a completed application with application fee, a copy of your most recent tax return, a signed fee agreement for the specific country, a signed disclosure statement, and a snapshot photo of you and your family. Step 3: Upon receipt and acceptance of your application, Hand In Hand will send you an invitation to attend our mandatory pre-adoptive parent group training sessions (if you reside in Arizona, Colorado, Florida, Indiana or Minnesota). The agency requires 30-35 hours of training, with the structure of the training varying with the state. If you reside in a state other than Arizona, Colorado, Florida, Indiana or Minnesota, training will be provided by the licensed agency in your state that will be doing your home study. Areas of education provided by Hand In Hand include Immigration, the home study process, paperwork processing, types of children available, attachment and bonding, trans-racial and trans-cultural adoptions, medical considerations, core issues in adoption, parenting skills, and more. Step 4: With our guidance, you will be busy collecting medical reports, original birth certificates, marriage/divorce certificates, employment verification, physical examination forms, and other documents needed to build your dossier. Each country has its own requirements for dossier documents, and we will assist you with each one. Step 5: Once a portion of your required documents have been turned in, a home study will be scheduled with a licensed social worker. The home study visit is done in the informal atmosphere of your home. The home study is one of the pillars of the adoption case, as it goes to Immigration, your state of residence, and to the foreign country. If you reside in a state other than Arizona, Colorado, Florida, Indiana or Minnesota, you will locate a licensed agency in your state to complete the home study. If you need assistance or a list of possible agencies, Hand In Hand can help. Step 6: Upon dossier completion, Hand In Hand will complete all necessary legalizations and authentications of your documents. The dossier will then be sent to the respective country for review, acceptance and matching with a child. With a match, you will see pictures of the child and a case study (some countries provide a video of the child). Acceptance of the match is your decision. This is a lifetime commitment that you are making, and we want you to make the best decision for this child. If you need more time or have additional questions, we will work with the foreign country to attempt to get the answers for you. While you are making this decision, Hand In Hand is available to discuss any concerns or questions you may have or to discuss possible resources. Step 7: Upon match acceptance, the country is notified and the process is initiated for preparing to travel to get your child. The time frame from match acceptance to travel for placement will vary with each country. Step 8: A travel meeting will be scheduled with your Hand In Hand adoption specialist or program director. During this meeting, we will help you prepare for the trip, make travel arrangements, and understand the adoption finalization process. We have liaisons in each country with which we work who will meet you at the airport in the foreign country and assist you throughout your stay. Step 9: Finally! You will travel to the country to meet your child and will have the assistance of a representative, who will also help with the legal process in that country. Step 10: You and your wonderful child (or children) will head home with either a guardianship or a final decree of adoption, depending upon the host country. Step 11: A series of scheduled post placement visits and reports will be done by your social worker. The first visit is done within two weeks to one month after you return home. At this visit, we ask that you provide us with photos of your child to forward to the country with each required report. These post placement visits are meant to provide you with support, adjustment help, and finally to thank the country for making the decision to place the child internationally. When we show the foreign countries that adoptions are successful, it keeps the doors open for many more children to find their forever homes.  Step 12: Depending on the laws of your country and state, we ask that you go to court six or twelve months after returning home for the purpose of validating your child’s adoption in the U.S.  Step 13: We will assist you in obtaining a new birth certificate, a Social Security number, and citizenship documentation. Step 14: You’re ready to start again! And many of our families do, as close to 50% of families opt to adopt through Hand In Hand a second or even third time!"
;"KidsFirst Adoption Services, LLC";"Licensed";"9135 North Meridian Street, Suite B-4";"Indianapolis";"IN";46260;(317) 843-2300;;;;;"info@kidsfirstadoption.com";"http://kidsfirstadoption.com/";"KidsFirst Adoption Services, LLC. (KFAS) is an Indiana licensed, private adoption agency founded in 1998 by Inna and Steven Pecar. Inna immigrated to the United States from Ukraine in 1991. She has a Master's degree in social work. Her husband, Steven Pecar, is a U.S.-born attorney.  KidsFirst began operations in March of 1999, and has continuously placed (or assisted in the placement of) children since. KidsFirst International Adoption, Inc. (KFIA) is a non-profit adoption agency licensed in 2006 to provide adoption services in accordance with the ""Hague Convention on the Protection of Children and Cooperation in Respect of Inter-country Adoption"". KFIA primarily provides adoption services for the placement of children from ""Convention"" countries, including but not limited to Bulgaria.

We currently work extensively with families adopting children from Bulgaria, Ethiopia, Ukraine, and the United States. We have also assisted families adopting from numerous other countries. KFAS and KFIA are looking to open new adoption programs, and are excited to bring new opportunities to waiting children and families.";"International Adoption; Domestic Adoption";"Domestic Adoption Process: 1.  Agency consultation - You will meet with our agency director and staff to learn about the program and determine what is best for your family.  You will learn about open, semi-open, and closed adoptions.  Afterwards, you will begin to formulate your adoption plan, and understand your specific role in the adoption process. 2.  Agency application and completion of a Home Study - This can be completed by KidsFirst, a licensed social worker, and/or another licensed home study agency.  Your final agency approval is contingent upon the recommendation for approval that is issued by your home study agent.  Your social worker should be able to advise you of your state’s policies regarding approval.  You may also complete an education on birth family issues, adoptee issues, and adoptive parenting. 3.  Matching - Once your home study is approved and your dossier is complete, you are ready to be matched with a potential birth mother.  The first step in the matching process is to clarify your child preference.  It is important to be honest with yourself, and with your caseworker, in identifying the child you would like to adopt.  It will be helpful to make an inventory of what you are hoping for in a child.  You can prioritize the most important characteristics: i.e., social/health status of the birth mother, race, etc.  Although we try to reasonably honor your preferences, please be advised that if your list of criteria is too restrictive, you will significantly narrow your options for referral.  There needs to be a mutual level of comfort between the birth family and the adoptive family. You should clarify with your caseworker what your preferences are concerning an open, semi-open, or closed adoption.  In an open adoption, identifying information is fully disclosed, and contact between the birth family and adoptive family is frequent and continuous, depending on the agreement between the families.  In a closed adoption, all identifying information is confidential, and there is no contact between the birth family and the adoptive family.  A semi-open adoption falls somewhere along the continuum, often allowing for an initial meeting between birth and adoptive families, as well as occasional correspondence through the agency in regards to child pictures and information.  The families and the birth mothers both have the freedom to determine their level of openness in the adoption.  You will only be matched with a birth mother whose preferences match your own.  It is important to note that many birth mothers prefer open adoption, as it is considered a healthy choice for her.  Please consider the well-being of all members of the adoption triad while formulating this plan. Once you have clarified your child preference, the length of time until you are matched with a mother will vary.  There is no way to predict the length of time; it will be different for each family.  Your referral comes in the form of a medical abstract of the birth mother, containing prenatal information and pictures.  Sometimes a meeting will be appropriate.  KidsFirst would like you to make an informed decision before moving forward with a birth parent match.  We encourage you to present the received information to an independent doctor for second opinions. There are several avenues for gathering additional information about a potential child, and for clarifying any questions your consultants may have.  You will communicate your questions through your caseworker.  Generally, answers can be obtained within a week.  If necessary, conference calls can be arranged between your consultant and the prenatal doctor, or with any other professionals involved. 4. The child's birth - Once you have accepted a match, you will begin your relationship with the birth family.  In some cases, financial support of the birth mother is necessary.  This will be determined on a case-by-case basis.  Your wait will be dependent on the birth mother’s due date.  You may begin working on any necessary travel preparations.  You may be invited to the hospital for the child's birth, or you may be asked to refrain from visiting, depending on the birth mother’s wishes.  All parties involved must be supportive of each other during this difficult time.  KidsFirst will have staff available to both the adoptive parent and the birth mother at the time of the child's birth. You must remember that no child belongs to you until the final papers are signed.  This is very difficult to understand, as you will likely feel connected to the birth mother and the child, which you may perceive as being yours throughout the process.  Though KidsFirst does all it can to ensure that a birth mother does not proceed with an adoption plan unless certain, things can change once the child is born.  Nationally, about 20% of birth mothers change their minds after the child's birth.  The birth mother has a minimum of 48 hours (after the birth) before she makes her final decision.  Once the decision has been made, it is final and cannot be revoked.  It is in the best interests of your family that the birth mother makes the best decision for her and her child. Once the birth mother signs the relinquishment papers, you will complete your adoption petition to the court.  At that point, the child will be legally, and officially, yours forever. KidsFirst's team of staff will work to guide you through the complexities surrounding the process.  We will ensure that the adoption is carried out in a safe, efficient, and sensitive manner.  We strive to minimize anxiety for both parties throughout the process. International  Adoption Process: 1.  Apply to U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services (USCIS) - You can complete this by submitting an I-600A form, for non-Hague countries, or an I-800A form, for Hague countries.  To establish your ability of providing proper parental care, you must submit a home study completed by an approved agency within your home state.  As part of the processing of your case, USCIS (or sometimes, the Department of State) will conduct an overseas investigation verifying the orphanhood of the child.  To expedite a USCIS approval, submit your application as quickly as possible, even if you have not yet completed a home study.  The filing of this application will enable USCIS to set a date for fingerprinting.  Upon the submission of a completed home study, USCIS will already have your file, and (assuming your application is satisfactory) will be able to issue your adoption approval in the form of an I-171H (non-Hague), or an I-797 (Hague). Once you have received approval, a cable is sent to the American embassy in your country of operation.  Your USCIS approval will be valid for 18 months, and your fingerprints will be valid for 15 months.  For more links and information, click here. 2.  Completion of an international home study - This can be done through KidsFirst, a licensed social worker, and/or another licensed home study agency.  Your final BCIS approval is contingent upon the recommendation for approval given by your home study agent.  In some states, including Indiana, you are allowed to file an I-600A prior to, or during the home study process.  In other states you cannot file for BCIS approval until your home study has been completed.  Your social worker should be able to advise you of the policies regarding this in your state of residence.  Your completed home study is valid for 12 months, though an update may be necessary if circumstances change prior to your adoption. 3. Completion of a dossier - Once you have applied with our agency, you will be given a dossier packet.  Your dossier consists of all the documents necessary for processing your adoption in the country of operation.  We will go over the preparation of your dossier in detail.  These documents require authentication through notarization.  In some states, a county-level certification may be necessary.  Our staff is available to answer any questions you have regarding the dossier.  The dossier completion time-frame is up to you; however, your child referral cannot begin until it is completed, and in our possession.  For our Indiana families, we will schedule an appointment to finalize the dossier, at which time you will sign your documents in front of us.  We will notarize them and submit them to the proper country. 4. Child referral - Once your dossier is complete and you have received notification of your BCIS approval, you are ready for a child referral.  The first step is to clarify your child preferences.  It is important to be honest with yourself and your caseworker in identifying the child you would like to adopt.  It is helpful to take an inventory of your child preferences, and to prioritize the most important characteristics (i.e. - sex, age, health status, etc.  Though we try to honor your preferences, please be advised that if your list of criteria is too restrictive, you may significantly narrow your referral options. Once you have clarified your child preferences, you will receive a referral in as short a time period as a few weeks, all the way up to 6-8 month.  This is dependent on your child preferences, and the country that you are hoping to adopt from.  Referrals come in the form of a medical abstract, complete with pictures, and (occasionally) video.  Medical abstracts are faxed to you immediately, while pictures and/or video is sent over-hight through mail.  Medicals usually include birth information (weight, height, head, and chest circumferences), Apgar scores, availability information, medical diagnoses, and other updated measurements.  Information regarding birth parents is minimal, if available at all. KidsFirst would like you to make the most informed decision possible in accepting a child.  We advise our families to consult with a pediatrician and/or physician for second opinions. There are several avenues used for gathering additional information about a child.  You will communicate your questions through your caseworker.  Answers are generally obtained within a week.  If necessary, conference calls can be arranged between your consultant, an orphanage physician, facilitator, or lawyer.  This depends on the phone access in the territory of operation. 5. Acceptance of a referral and travel - Once you have accepted a child, your dossier is sent to the applicable country, and a court date is scheduled for you.  Your travel dates are scheduled around this court appearance.  The travel lengths and details are different for each country. Our overseas coordinators will meet you upon arrival in the country of adoption.  Coordinators arrange your in-country travel/accommodations, help with translation, walk you through the legal/adoption process, troubleshoot, solve problems, and manage your schedule.  They are there to ensure that the adoption progresses in a safe, efficient, and culturally sensitive manner."

The Commission recommended to the General Board of the General Association of General Baptists and then was presented by the Board at the 1987 General Association that the Social Issues Commission be instructed to incorporate a General Baptist adoption agency and ministry to unwed mothers as a not-for-profit corporation in the state of Indiana. The licensing procedure to be incorporated in the state of Indiana continued over the better part of two years.  On September 1, 1989, Compassionate Care opened its doors at Howell General Baptist Church in Evansville, Indiana as a Licensed Child Placing Agency and began accepting applications for adoptions.  This exciting new ministry served General Baptists and other Christian families in every state through the Compassionate Care office.  Mary Lou Howard was selected as the first director and served until 1991.  Dr. John Clanton assumed the director a short time later and faithfully directed the ministry of Compassionate Care until his tragic death in 2006. Compassionate Care has successfully developed over the years since its inception and has changed some of its policies.  The emphasis by the turn of the century became more and more of an adoption agency through which adoptive parents were adopting babies internationally.  Also, the offices of Compassionate Care were moved to Oakland City University Wilder Center in Oakland City, Indiana. Dr. Darrell W. Hillhouse became the third executive director of Compassionate Care from 2007-2012.  David Kelle joined the Compassionate Care Staff in 2012 and is currently serving as its 4th Executive Director.  Under his leadership the offices of CCAMI are now strategically located in Evansville, Indiana. In the early years of this much needed ministry, it was reported to the General Association of General Baptists that “Compassionate Care is working!” It has continued “working” unceasingly throughout the years. Happily, in fact, Compassionate Care Adoption Ministries, Inc. has facilitated 168 adoptions since its beginning in 1989.";"Adoption";

Our adoption services are offered without regard to age, ethnic origin, religion, marital status, physical characteristics or disability or number of children in the home. All of our client services are individualized to best meet the needs of those involved in each adoption plan. Open, semi-open and closed adoptions are all available.";"Adoption";"Here are the basics of how the overall adoption process works: By law, all prospective adoptive families are carefully screened in a pre-placement “home study” and must be approved by a licensed provider like Adoption Connection before a child can be placed with them. At Adoption Connection, prospective adoptive families take an adoption preparation class  to learn about developmental milestones for adopted children, talking to their child about their adoption story, creating positive self-esteem about birth families, and more. Prospective adoptive families create their family “profile” for viewing by expectant and birth parents. Expectant and birth parents typically choose the family for their child as part of their adoption plan before or after the child is born.  Adoption plans may be closed, open and semi-open adoption plans depending on the wishes of the placing parents. After the child is born, the parental rights of the birth parents are voluntarily terminated in court so the child can later be adopted.  Adoption Connection provides ongoing support for birth parents as long as needed after this process is completed.  Ongoing updates about the child are also available to all birth parents if desired. Once a child begins living with their new family, Adoption Connection “supervises” for at least 6 months.   Older children may require more time to adjust  so not all adoptions are finalized exactly after 6 months. When all post-placement requirements are met,  Adoption Connection provides a ‘consent’ for the family to adopt the child legally through a court process. In Iowa, court records of termination and adoption are confidential and sealed after each step is completed. Adoption Connection services are also confidential and no identifying information about you can be shared without your consent. Adoptive families placed through Adoption Connection have an agreed communication plan to provide pictures and updates on their child after adoption for a specified period, to help  birth parents know their child is healthy and loved by the family they chose!"

Challenges always exist during adoption…what matters is how we handle the challenges. As your partner, it is the mission of Graceful Adoptions to deliver services with kindness, respect, honesty, and integrity. By staying focused on our mission, the adoption experience really will be the personal experience it should be.";"Adoption";"Step One - Complete your Home Study. An adoption Home Study is a legal requirement for any adoption and must be completed through an organization in your state licensed to complete Home Studies. This can be the longest part of the process so starting early is the smart thing to do.Once your Home Study is complete, send a signed and notarized original, along with all the supporting documents, to Graceful Adoptions. Step Two - Complete Graceful Adoptions’ Application and Submit the Application Fee. Graceful Adoption’s Application provides Adoptive Parents the flexibility to request the race, age, gender, family medical conditions and uterine exposure to drugs and alcohol of a child they feel comfortable parenting. Once activated, this information is used create a match between adoptive parents and parents placing a child for adoption. Step Three - Application Interview. During the Application Interview, the prospective adoptive parents and Graceful Adoptions’ Service Director talk about preparedness for the life-long commitment of adoption. This is a good time to review expectations to ensure we are the right agency for you. Step Four - Complete Graceful Adoptions’ Activation Documents. The activation documents include Graceful Adoptions’ Agency Agreement; Processes, Procedures and Guidelines; Insurance Affidavit and the Family Activation Fee. Once the activation documents are completed and returned, it’s time to work on your Family Profile. Step Five - Complete the Family Profile. Graceful Adoptions’ Family Profile template and dropbox for pictures makes it easy to provide the information needed to develop the adoptive parents’ profile. All profiles are professionally designed and edited, and approved by the family prior to finalization. Once completed, the Family Profile is used to present the adoptive family to parents considering adoption for their child. Step Six - Complete the Match Process. Based on the mother’s preferences, adoptive parent profiles are presented to her for consideration. Once she identifies one or more adoptive families that she is interested in knowing better we arrange phone interviews. Held between the parents making the adoption plan and the adoptive parents, this call allows the parents placing to ask the adoptive parents questions about how they will raise the child.Once the parents select an adoptive family they want to parent their child, Graceful Adoptions’ Service Director has a discussion with the prospective adoptive parents to review the circumstances of the match and confirm their preparedness for this specific child. When Graceful Adoptions’ Service Director approves the Match, the adoptive parents are provided the following information and asked to approve the Match: Match Agreement, Communications Plan, Proof of Pregnancy, Self-reported Medically Diagnosed Conditions Form, Self-reported Drug and Alcohol Usage Form, Medical and Living Expenses Form. Step Seven - Child’s Birth and Hospital Stay. This is usually a very confusing and challenging time for adoptive parents. Even though they may be a part of the child’s birth and/or hospital plan, in most cases they have no legal rights to the child until the parents sign documents, usually 48 to 72 hours following the child’s birth.There will be Hospital Plan created as part of the mother’s Adoption Plan. This Plan outlines the mother’s desire for her hospital experience and is provided to the hospital staff to communicate the mother’s wishes.The adoptive parents will receive a separate document which outlines their role and responsibilities during the hospital stay. Step Eight - Placement of the Child and ICPC. Adoptive parents usually take physical custody of the child when they are discharged from the hospital.If you are placed with an older child, the Transition Plan developed for the mother and child with Graceful Adoptions will be followed.Adoptive Parents must stay in the state the child is born in until they receive approval from both state’s ICPC office. With Graceful Adoptions’ this usually takes place within 7-12 days following the birth of the child. Step Nine - Post Placement Supervision and Finalization. Just as the adoption Home Study is the adoptive parents’ approval to adopt, Post Placement Supervision is required for the adoptive parents to finalize the adoption. Post Placement Supervision is a process to ensure the child is being cared for and the adoption placement is successful. Upon completion, an adoption attorney will finalize the adoption. A final court hearing will be held and the adoption decree will be granted. The child will then receive a new birth certificate with the last name of the adoptive parents."

Centrally located in the United States, Dillon International is based in Tulsa, Oklahoma, and was the first licensed international adoption agency in the state. Throughout our history, Dillon International has been actively involved in establishing intercountry adoption standards and policies both in the United States and abroad. The agency has helped to establish adoption programs in several countries, including a model foster care program in Korea. Each participating country in the agency’s adoption program has invited Dillon International to help find homes for their vulnerable children. Since our beginning, Dillon International has placed over 6,000 children from developing countries with loving, adoptive families in the United States. Several hundred additional children have been placed with families in their country of birth as a result of Dillon’s efforts. In addition, Dillon International has helped to underwrite hospitals, orphanages and schools in Korea, India, China, and most recently in Vietnam.";"Adoption";"APPLICATION: This allows our agency to get acquainted with your family and determine if your  family meets the requirements for our agency and the U.S. government. We will help you determine which intercountry programs you qualify for, since each of the foreign countries has varying requirements. PRE-ADOPTION WORKSHOP: This is a required online course that prepares your family for what to expect throughout the adoption process, with particular focus on country-specific family requirements  and procedures. This course must be completed prior to receiving the Home Study Application. HOME STUDY APPLICATION: This is a collection of documents and information about your family that is required based on state, U.S. and foreign government regulations. The application helps us get to know you better, assists the social worker’s preparation of the home study, and helps your family “rehearse” for dossier preparation. Criminal background and child abuse checks are initiated at this time. The Home Study Application cannot be processed until all requested documents and copies are received. U.S. CITIZEN & IMMIGRATION SERVICES: USCIS determines each family’s eligibility and suitability to adopt a child from a foreign country. The process begins with your family filing the I-600A application (non-Hague adoption) or the I-800A application (Hague adoption) with USCIS. We will provide your family with instructions for filing either form after Application Part 2 is approved. USCIS will inform your family of the location and date to have fingerprints taken for a FBI criminal background check. If approved, USCIS will send your family an approval notice. The I-600A is valid for 18 months; the I-800A is valid for 15 months. Your family must renew either form filed as many times as necessary to ensure the USCIS approval is valid at the time the child’s U.S. visa is issued. INTERNATIONAL ADOPTION SEMINAR: This provides your family an in-depth learning opportunity to explore issues relevant for intercountry adoption and adoptive families and helps your family build realistic expectations for both the adoption experience and the child joining your family.  Topics include: attachment, grief and loss, medical issues, impact of institutionalization and environment on child development, talking to your child about adoption, racial and cultural identity, initial adjustments and more. Your family must complete the seminar prior to completing your home study. Completion of the seminar helps fulfill the USCIS and Hague Treaty requirement for pre-adoption counseling and education. This is an online class available on www.dillonadopt.com. HOME STUDY: This is an evaluation of your family, which is requested after the Home Study Application has been approved. A social worker usually has two to four visits with your family, including a home visit to get to know you, your parenting styles, your resources, and your reasons for adopting. The intent of the home study is to assess your family’s readiness and suitability to adopt a child. The Home Study also helps educate and prepare your family for the adoption experience and the child joining your family. The social worker will submit a current home study in compliance with the require ments set up by your state of residence, U.S. government and the foreign country.  Our Agency will provide the social worker with guidelines for preparing your home study and will review your home study to ensure it complies with requirements. DOSSIER: Once your family’s home study is completed, your family will prepare a dossier for submission to the foreign country you have chosen (with the exception of Korea). The dossier is a set of legal documents, which includes your family’s home study and provides information, which helps foreign government officials in determining if your family meets the country’s requirements for adopting a child. We review your family’s dossier documents to ensure they meet country requirements. Depending on the country, our staff may also process the documents and obtain authentication or apostille certificates. CHILD REFERRAL: Our Agency receives information on a child from the foreign country. The child’s information is then presented to your family by your home study social worker or an agency representative. Referral information will include one or more photos of the child, a social and medical history on the child and any medical treatment records and birth family information available. Your family is given at least two weeks to carefully consider the child’s information and to have your physician and other medical specialists review the information before deciding whether to accept the referral of the child. CHILD ASSIGNMENT: This happens after your family accepts a referral of a specific child. Assignment paperwork is sent to the foreign country and the authorities there take the steps necessary for the adoption process to proceed forward. PARENTING EDUCATION: Parenting an adopted child can have unique joys and challenges. We require all adoptive parents to complete a series of education requirements, including several online adoption courses and recommended parenting books prior to receiving their child. Your family will receive the Parent Education Requirements checklist with the Home Study Application. CHILD ARRIVAL: This will depend on whether your family has selected to adopt from a country that allows children to be escorted to the U.S. or whether your family must travel to receive your child. We will notify you when your child is ready to come home and will provide preparation and guidance about travel. POST-PLACEMENT SUPERVISION. This is provided by your family’s home study provider. The first visit must be done within four weeks of your child’s arrival home. Your social worker will assess your family and child’s adjustments to each other and provide support to help with the transition. An additional two to ten visits will be made with your family over a six-month to five-year period, depending on the country. After a minimum of six months, your social worker can recommend the finalization (or re-finalization) of your child’s adoption in the U.S.  In addition, some countries require families to provide periodic update reports for several years after the adoption, sometimes until the child is 18 years old. ADOPTION FINALIZATION: Depending on the country, the adoption may be finalized in the child’s birth country or in the U.S.  Either way, it is important to have the adoption finalized, re-finalized, or recognized in a U.S. court.  We recommend that your family retains an attorney with intercountry adoption experience to assist you with this process and with obtaining a U.S. birth certificate for your child. U.S. CITIZENSHIP: This is the final step in the adoption process. If your child enters the U.S. on an IR4 or IH4 visa, you will submit Form N600 to USCIS to receive a Certificate of U.S. Citizenship for your child after the adoption is finalized in the U.S.  If your child enters the U.S. on a IR3 or IH3 visa, your family will automatically receive your child’s Certificate of U.S. Citizenship usually within 45 days of arriving home.  We require all families to obtain a Certificate of U.S. Citizenship for their child because the certificate is a non-expiring, irrefutable record of your child’s U.S. citizenship."

The greatest effort spent on each couple will be the home study. A home study is a series of interviews in which the social worker concentrates on collecting information via face-to-face contact with each couple. The home study typically consists of an orientation interview followed by 4 home study interviews. 1. The first interview is a home visit in which the social worker will address each of the qualifications for adoption. This is a joint interview. 2. The next visits are individual interviews and are typically held at the LCS office. Both spouses may come on the same day, if they must travel to get to the office. If they are local, each spouse may schedule his or her own interview at his convenience. The interviews will be autobiographical in nature and will be based on an Autobiography written by the applicant. The social worker will ask that you complete this Autobiography prior to this interview. 3. The third interview will focus on parenting philosophies and plans. Issues such as experience and exposure to children, the applicants’ parenting received when they were children, values and discipline will be explored. 4. The fourth interview will focus on adoption education. We will discuss how to educate the child on his or her adoptive status, how to educate others, proper words and timing, books on adoption, trans-racial adoptions, contact with birth parents, background information on any prospective adopted child, completing a profile and many other issues common to adoption. Education is a very important part of the home study process. Each family in the domestic program is required to attend Lifeline’s domestic adoption conference in Birmingham, Alabama. This conference is a two day interactive training which will prepare and equip families for the joys and challenges of domestic adoption. After the home study process is completed, families will begin the matching process. Each family will create a family profile. Family profile’s are shown based on the birth mother’s preferences. Lifeline requires that at a minimum adoptive couples be willing to meet the birth mother before the adoption takes place, and to send correspondence through Lifeline to the birth family after the placement."

Families and society have changed since 1849, but at St. Joe's our commitment to children and families in need has not. Since the 1970's St. Joseph Children's Home has evolved into a more diversified child caring facility with a multitude of programs to help families face the challenges of life. The Therapeutic Foster Care and Adoption Program was established in 1996. The children are referred to the program from our own Residential Treatment Program and from various social service agencies in the state of Kentucky. These are children who have suffered abuse and neglect, have been uprooted from their family, home and neighborhood, and who need not only the love of new families but also the structure and guidance of well trained parents. Even though there are no longer orphans at St. Joe's, there are many, many children who need quality foster care and adoptive homes. Unfortunately the reality is there are always more children than there are homes. We are in need of families interested in fostering and adopting. We are especially looking for parents interested in sibling groups, older children, teens, children with behavior problems and children with special needs. We provide extensive training and support. ";"Foster Care and Adoption";"The application/certification process takes about 3-4 months. There is a 10 session/36 hour training program which covers the basic topics you will need to know to bring a foster child into your family. CPR/First Aid certification is required. There is also paperwork and background checks and references to gather. After training is complete there will be a home visit where the placement specialist goes over health and safety issues in the home and discuses any questions you might have. A Home Study is written that assesses the potential adoptive family and summarizes their strengths, skills, attitudes and other qualifications that bear on the challenges of adoptive parenting. Then a match is sought. Having children come live with you is a big commitment, so finding the right match is crucial. Children are placed for adoption by matching their needs with adoptive parents' or families' situations. You will never be forced to accept a child, you select the level of needs and age range you will consider. There is a minimum of a 6 month window prior to finalization during which the child is placed in your home for adoption but remains under the care of the state. If the placement is stable and everyone is ready, finalization of the adoption proceeds. "

The state of Louisiana requires a home study for any couple or individual who wants to adopt. If a family is planning to adopt internationally, a home study is required by the Immigration and Naturalization Service as well. A home study consists of 4-6 interviews, one of which is a home visit. An individual interview is held with each member of the adoptive family in order to obtain biographical information. The main purpose of the home study, however, is to educate families about adoption and the special issues that adoptive families face. Adoptive parents must deal with such things as explaining adoption to their child, handling their child’s questions about his or her biological parents, and to understand that both heredity and environment work together to create a unique person.";"Adoption Home Studies; Post-Placement Studies";
