We tailor the adoption process to the wishes of the birthparent, not the adopting parents. At St. Elizabeth Foundation, we mainly do variations of what are called open adoptions. In an open adoption, it is the birthparent who is able to choose the adopting parents and choose the relationship and/or desired frequency and method of future communication with the adoptive parents and the child. We also serve those seeking to build a family through adoption, guiding them through our step-by-step process. If any of our experienced adoption staff can be of assistance to you, please contact us. We are happy to answer your questions. If you are looking to create the best future for yourself and baby or are looking to build a family through adoption, adoption is a wonderful option.

The agency, established in 1902, is private, non-profit and non-sectarian. At Good Samaritan Agency, we believe that every child needs and deserves the security of a permanent, loving family. We further believe there are many individuals and couples who want to build families by responding to the needs of children who do not have stable homes. Since 1909, we’ve been matching the needs of children and families through adoption. At Good Samaritan Agency, we provide a full service in-state domestic adoption program. We also work with out-of-state agencies to assist in the placement of children with Maine families. For families seeking to adopt internationally, Good Samaritan Agency, may be able to complete your homestudy and post-placement services. Good Samaritan Agency can also complete private homestudies for families working privately towards an adoption.";"In-state Domestic Adoption; Out-of-State Domestic Adoption; International Adoption";"Good Samaritan Agency begins the process with individual adoption informational sessions. This gives your family a chance to sit down with an adoption caseworker and discuss the process and ask questions. Adoption informationals are scheduled on an individual basis. Once a family has decided to work with Good Samaritan Agency, they must then submit a formal adoption application packet. As part of the application packet, adoptive applicants are required to write autobiographies, complete medical examinations, provide references, financial documentation, and releases for the agency to conduct background checks on all adults living in the household. Once your application packet has been processed and all background checks have cleared, you will be assigned to an adoption caseworker. The caseworker will begin the homestudy with your family. The homestudy is an in-depth evaluation of your life experiences, problem solving abilities and motivation for adoption. The homestudy uses information gathered in the application as well as a series of interviews, both individually and jointly, and a home visit. All homestudies are reviewed in a peer review session by all casework staff before approval is granted. Once the homestudy is approved, you are now an approved adoptive family, waiting for a placement. After a child is placed in your home for the purpose of adoption, your caseworker will continue to monitor your adjustment by meeting with your family as required and completing the post-placement supervision reports. This supervision period is defined by law and is typically 6 months in length. After the required supervision period, families can legalize the adoption through the Probate Court system. Good Samaritan Agency will assist your family with the legalization process."

Once you have made contact with us and our staff have gone over the general requirements of our adoption program [such as minimum age, residency etc.] you will be invited to attend an informational meeting, with other families wishing to adopt. Our staff will: Explain the ages and characteristics of the children with special needs that we have for placement; Help your family to develop and clarify your expectations about your abilities to meet these special needs of our children; Discuss the eligibility standards of our agency; Talk about the stages of the adoptive and foster care process and reasonable times for completing these stages. Step 3 - Adoptive and Foster Family Training. You will then be invited to attend our Adoptive and Foster Family Training, which consists of 24 hours of preparatory training for parenting children with special needs. This is done in eight weekly sessions, lasting three hours each, or over four consecutive Saturdays. The sessions include the grief and loss process, how children come into care, working as a team to meet the needs of a child, how to cope with challenging behaviors in children and many other core issues in foster and adoptive care. These classes are taught by experienced adoptive and foster parents. Step 4 - Family Study. You and your family will be asked to write autobiographies and participate in a series of interviews with a social worker. These interviews allow you and the social worker the opportunity to discuss your family's history and functioning, including your strengths and challenges, and how that may play out by adopting a child with special needs. Step 5 - Matching and Placement. After you have completed the training and study process, and are approved as meeting our agency standards, you will given a regular photo-listing of children available for adoption in Maine and matched according to the child's needs and your ability to meet those needs. Our focus is on finding families for children. Once the match is made between a child[ren] and your family, a complete presentation of the child's history and needs is made. Then a negotiation process is done to provide adoption assistance to your family, dependent on the needs of the child[ren] and the circumstances of your family. This is followed by a ""visitation"" time which can last from several days to several weeks, depending on the needs of the individual child/family. Step 6 - Post-Placement. Once a child[ren] are placed in your home full-time, you will have regular home visits to help ""fine-tune"" the adjustment issues. These visits will continue at least 6 months, until the agency can recommend the adoption be legalized in court. You may choose an attorney to represent you in court. After the adoption hearing in probate court, you will then have sole legal responsibility for your child. Step 7 - Post-Legalization Adoption Services. We believe that adoption is a lifelong process. All adopting families experience normal ""developmental"" crisis in their lifetimes. DHHS provides an Adoption Assistance Program and through this subsidy, and medical insurance through Medicaid, many services are able to be accessed and funded. Our caseworkers are available to provide consultation and referral for services. This includes post-legalization parent support groups. "

After we receive your application, the staff will review it, and if necessary, will explore any significant background issues (prior arrests, physical or mental health issues, abuse/neglect, addictions). You will then be matched with your social worker, who will guide you through your adoption journey. She will send you an outline to help you write an autobiography. After you send in your autobiography, your social worker will contact you to schedule a preliminary interview. The preliminary interview begins the Family Assessment (home study) process. 2. Family Assessment and Education (Home Study). Catholic Charities has the responsibility of assessing prospective parents’ suitability for adoption, and for preparing them to be the best adoptive parents possible.  Our assessment and education process includes individual and couple interviews in our office and a home visit. These meetings help your social worker get to know you well and help you to develop a personalized adoption plan.  In addition you will attend two adoption education classes, where you will meet other prospective adoptive families and will learn about the unique issues and challenges of being an adoptive family. 3. Services After the Home Study and Before Placement. We have found that the waiting period before your child’s placement can be one of the most difficult times for you. Catholic Charities offers continuing opportunities for support, education, and contact with other waiting families and our staff.  We offer and Infant and Toddler Care course for adoptive parents, we provide a monthly support group, and ongoing individual support from our staff. When you receive a possible referral of a child, we can provide referrals to medical and developmental professionals to help you interpret and evaluate the information. 4. Post Placement Services. Following the placement of your child, we will provide post-placement services to help you and your child adjust to each other. Many countries require that your placement agency send reports for several years after placement.  Your post placement period will vary depending on the country from which you are adopting. Your social worker will meet with you in your home and in our office during this time.  We will also assist you to finalize (or re-finalize) your child’s adoption in court, and to apply for your child’s U.S. citizenship, if necessary. 5.

Submit application to Cradle of Hope. Your Cradle of Hope support team will schedule an orientation meeting. 2. Begin a homestudy, which is a series of meetings with a social worker in your state to learn about issues related to international adoption, to determine your suitability to parent an adopted child, and to help you prepare for the experience. Cradle of Hope provides homestudy services to Maryland and Virginia families. 3. Submit I-600A or I-800A application to your local JCIS office. Processing of your application can take several months, so you should begin this step even if you have not decided on a country from which to adopt, or if your homestudy is not complete. Cradle of Hope will provide a sample completed form for you. 4. Collect the documents (dossier) required by the country from which you are adopting, such as your birth certificates, marriage certificate, employment letters, references, and medical clearances. Many of these documents will also be required for completion of your homestudy, and must be notarized, authenticated, translated, and approved by the embassy of the country from which you plan to adopt. Cradle of Hope will provide you with step-by-step guidance about dossier preparation. 5. Consider a child referral. Consult medical experts. Accept referral. 6. Prepare for travel and your stay abroad with assistance from your Cradle support team. While waiting to travel, collect donations to take to the orphanage for the children who will remain behind. 7. Travel to your child’s country to meet him/her and finalize the adoption. Most families’ trips will be a few days to several weeks, depending on the country. In some programs, two or three trips are required, but only one parent must travel on some trips. Bilingual coordinators guide you through the process overseas. Your Cradle of Hope support team will be in regular phone contact with you throughout your trip, and with your family back home. 8. Obtain an immigrant visa for your child from U.S. Embassy. Return home with your child!! 9. Participate in post-placement supervision with your homestudy agency, which includes several visits over a time frame specified by your child’s birth country (usually 1 to 3 years) to make sure that the placement is going well, and to offer support and assistance in the event that outside services are needed. Reports of these post-placement visits and photos of your child are forwarded to adoption officials in your child’s birth country so that they can know the child is loved and doing well. 10. Readopt your child in your state court, in order to obtain a U.S. birth certificate and adoption decree. If only one parent travels abroad or the child was escorted to the U.S., re-adoption is required. Domestic Adoption Process: 1. You will submit you completed application with a recent photo and a $500 application fee. 2. You will meet with a CHAC social worker for an orientation meeting in our Maryland office or by telephone for out of town families. 3. You will receive provisional acceptance into the program conditioned upon CHAC approval of your completed homestudy. 4. You will sign and return our Adoption Services Agreement. 5. You will begin the homestudy process, if not already done. 6. You will prepare your Family Profile for inclusion in our Waiting Parent Notebook. 7. Upon approval of your homestudy, we will notify you of your final acceptance into our program. 8. Your Family Profile will be posted in our Waiting Parent Notebook. 9.

The goal of Angel Adoptions is to ensure that all children have a permanent home, unconditional love, safety, security, and a family to call their own. Angel Adoptions can assist both birth parents and adoptive families with any type of adoption they are interested in pursuing. If you are pregnant and considering placing your child for adoption, we offer free counseling with no pressure or obligation to assist you in making this big decision. If you are interested in adopting a child, we can assist you with either a domestic or international adoption. Angel Adoptions prides itself on its in-depth knowledge of all aspects of the adoption process, it's high quality services, and most of all, its compassionate, friendly, and supportive staff who are available to answer all of your questions and support you through this process. We are here for you. Angel Adoptions is a licensed non-profit agency in the state of Massachusetts. Our fees are designed to be affordable and all applicants are welcome, regardless of race, religion, marital status, age, or sexual orientation. Angel Adoptions is only able to provide services for adoptive families in Massachusetts. However, if you live in another state we are happy to provide you with referrals to agencies in your area.";"Infant Adoption; International Adoption; Special Needs Adoption; Birth Parents Services";"Step 1 - The Consultation. If you need additional information about adoption before you are ready to begin, or  are unsure which type of adoption is right for you, the first step is to call Angel Adoptions to schedule a consultation. This 1-2 hour meeting will give you information regarding the options available to you, assist you in clarifying  your goals, hopes and, possible fears, and will inform you of the process necessary to complete your adoption. Step 2 - The Homestudy. Once you are ready to proceed, you can begin your homestudy. We know that many people are nervous about meeting the social worker and have heard frightening stories about how you are now going to be judged and evaluated. Please know that at Angel Adoptions we are here to support you - not criticize you. Our goal is to assist you in having a successful adoption. Your homestudy will consist of at least four meetings with a social worker, some in your home, and some in our office. During these meetings, we will continue your education about adoption and preparation for raising an adopted child. We will also gather information about your family and determine your readiness to adopt. This information will be written into a report called a homestudy. Step 3 - International paperwork. If you are adopting internationally, you will also be required to fill out additional paperwork for USCIS (United States Citizenship and Immigration Services) and a dossier for the foreign country. Your social worker will assist you with this paperwork. Step 4 - Locate an appropriate child. How this is done depends upon the type of adoption you are completing. We will assist you during this process. Your social worker will give you more specific details. If you are adopting internationally, your social worker will help you choose which country is right for you and help you to choose an international placement agency with a program in that country. Your international placement agency will then find a child in the country of your choice. If you are completing an infant adoption, your social worker will help you choose an agency, attorney or facilitator who will provide you with birthmother and child placing services. Your social worker will assist you in preparing a ""Dear Birthmother"" letter that will be shown to potential birthmothers. You may speak with several birthmothers on the phone or meet with them in person before an appropriate situation is found. Angel Adoptions provides birth parent counseling and some families may locate their birth parents through our agency, but we do not advertise for birth parents, so the majority of our families will locate their birth parents through other sources. Step 5 - The Wait. Yes, sorry to say, there will be a waiting period no matter which type of adoption you choose. The length of time can vary greatly depending on certain factors. Once we know more about your particular situation, your social worker will be able to give you details of how long a wait to anticipate. The average adoption takes 1-2 years. This is a good time frame to expand your support network, join appropriate adoption support groups, meet other adoptive families, read books, attend conferences, learn about the resources in your area, research schools and day care facilities, and prepare for the arrival of your child. Step 6 - The Match. You have now located a potential child. International - your international placing agency will send you a photograph (possibly a video) and information about the child's known history and medical conditions. Please be aware that the information available about children from other countries may be limited. It is recommended that you take this information to an expert in international adoption medicine (referrals will be given to you by your social worker). The doctor will review the available information to determine whether or not the child seems to be in good health. If you choose to accept the match, your international placing agency will complete the necessary paperwork for you in the foreign country. Infant - Once you have been matched with a birthmother, and depending upon circumstances, you may be in regular contact with the birth mother during her pregnancy. You may be required to provide living expenses to support her during the pregnancy. Your social worker will assist you with the details. Please know that if the match offered to you does not meet your criteria, you are free to turn it down and keep waiting for a more suitable situation. Step 7 - More Waiting. Yes unfortunately, there is still more waiting involved. Please use this time to continue to develop your support system, educate yourself about adoption and parenting, and prepare for the arrival of your child. International - The length of time you must wait after having a child identified and before you are able to travel to adopt your child varies for each country, from a few weeks to a few months. Please be aware that with international adoptions there are often unexpected complications and delays in processing paperwork as your adoption works its way through the various bureaucracies in each of the governments. Be prepared for delays. Infant - How far along the birthmother is in her pregnancy when you are matched with her can vary, so of course the wait for her to give birth can vary. You will generally be matched with a birthmother in her 6th to 9th month and be in touch with her during the rest of her pregnancy. Some birthmothers invite the adoptive parents to come to the medical appointments with her and allow them to participate more actively in the pregnancy, while others may choose to be more private during this time. Step 8 - The Placement. International - In most cases, one or both parents will be required to go to the other country to complete paperwork, possibly go to court, and to receive placement of the child. The length of time you will be required to stay depends on the country. In some cases, it is possible to have the child escorted back to this country. In most cases you will be able to complete the adoption of the child in the other country. In some cases you are given guardianship and are then required to complete the adoption in the United States. Infant - In most cases the adoptive family will be called when the birth mother goes into labor. Some birth parents invite you to be present at the birth, while some remain more private during this time. You will generally spend time with the birth parents at the hospital, and will be able to visit and take care of the baby in the hospital. In most cases, the child is placed directly with the adoptive parents upon discharge from the hospital, although some states or situations require temporary foster care while the legal process of adoption is completed. You will required to remain in the state where the baby was born until the paperwork and legal process is completed (ICPC - Interstate Compact for the Placement of Children.) This process generally takes 1 - 2 weeks. Step 9 - The Post Placement Supervision. International - Depending on the country you choose and the type of adoption that was completed in the other country, you may have a completed final adoption from that country or you may be required to complete the legalization in this country. Even if you have a completed adoption, many people choose to complete a ""re-adoption"" in this country which will then give you a US adoption decree and US birth certificate. Most countries require several post placement reports to be completed over the next few years to assure them that the child is healthy and well cared for in your home. How many reports and for what length of time depends upon the country you adopt from. Your social worker will be able to tell you more about the supervision required after you choose a country. Infant - After the child is placed in your home, you will continue to meet regularly with a worker from this agency for at least six months. During this time we will provide ongoing supervision, services, and referrals as needed to help you and your family adjust to the adoption. Step 10 - Legalization. After a minimum of 6 months, your social worker will submit legal paperwork to the probate court in your county to finalize the adoption. The court will assign a date and you will appear before a judge to legalize your adoption. Step 11 - Life. It is our sincere hope that all of our families will live happily-ever-after. However we recognize that adoption is a lifelong process. We are committed to being available to our families for ongoing support, counseling, consultation and referral as needed."

For more than 44 years, CSR has provided services to children in the care or custody of the Commonwealth of Massachusetts and to their families. CSR began with the understanding that too many families and children of every race, ethnic and linguistic background found themselves trapped in systems which they did not trust, and therefore could not use effectively to meet their needs. CSR's approach was to place the family at the center of the system - concentrating on building a network of professional and community supports that could nurture trusting relationships, communicate respect, and teach the skills of empowerment. In the early 1990's CSR added services for youth, and emergency and transitional housing services for homeless families and adults.";"Adoption Assessments; Intensive Foster Care; Family Resident Foster Care; Family Stabilization and Support; Family Visitation; Lifelong Family Connections; Parent Mentoring; Safe Passage";

Our domestic team will also work with you to understand the types of situations you are open to;  WHFC will present your profile to expectant parents considering adoption, and you will be notified when there is a possible match; In many cases, adoptive parents are able to receive their child directly from the hospital; On average, you can expect to meet with your social worker at least 3 times within the first 6 months of your child’s arrival. In fact, actual post-placement reporting requirements vary by state and/or the child’s country of birth, and can range from 6 months to several years;  After the mandated post-placement period, WHFC or your placing agency will assist you in finalizing your child’s adoption."

Forever Families is a non-profit licensed adoption placement and foster care agency, committed to providing the highest standards in adoption opportunities, with continuous support, adoption preparation and interventions.";"Infant and Domestic Adoptions; International Adoptions; State Ward National Ward Program";"DOMESTIC ADOPTIONS: Domestic adoption laws in Michigan changed in 1994, and Direct Placement (or Direct Consent) adoptions became legal. This new legal process eliminated adoption waiting lists. Now a birth parent seeking to place a child in an adoptive home can pick from a pool of adoptive parents and can legally transfer custody of the child after birth to the adoptive parents. Adoptive parents, in turn, will also sign a legal document that accepts this custody. Adoptive parents are able to have their child placed with them directly after birth; foster care is not necessary. An adoption petition along with supporting legal documents are then submitted to a Circuit-Family Court in the county where the adoptive parents reside. Most often a hearing is scheduled within 30 days of placement and parental rights are terminated. A formal adoption placement order is also issued at this time. This will begin six months of supervision for the adoptive parents and child. This has nothing to do with parental rights. Supervision consists of two home visits (every three months) between an adoption specialist and the family. A report is generated and presented to the Court to ensure adjustment is going well. At the end of the supervision period, presentation to the Court is made and finalization of the adoption is requested. The adoption process, of course, may vary depending on where the birth parent lives as opposed to the adoptive parents, or if the adoption involves an out of state placement. INTERNATIONAL ADOPTIONS: International adoptions have become very popular in recent years, as children ranging in age from three months and up have become available for adoption placement. Many parents enter international adoption programs because the need is great and the programs are successful. Once adoptive parents enter into this program, their goal of adopting children is usually successful within a predictable period of time, depending on the country. There are, however, many variables in an international adoption process that require adoptive parents to be flexible and patient. Children available for adoption internationally must be classified as an “orphan” according to United States immigration standards in order to get a visa to enter the country. The United States does not recognize private international adoptions and getting a visa for the privately adopted child to enter the country may be extremely difficult. International adoption involves three distinct roles; licensed agency, international intermediary and foreign staff. Service fees for an international adoption are generally associated with these three roles. These roles exist in all international adoptions; some agencies perform all tasks. Working with an agency that provides all three roles is not necessarily an advantage to adoptive parents. Licensed Agency: A licensed agency, such as Forever Families, initially involved in an international adoption, should prepare, educate and support the adoptive parents. They will complete an adoption pre-placement assessment and may be contracted to assist with the creation of the international dossier. Adoptive parents will pay for an adoption service application, a pre-placement assessment and possibly other contracted services. International Intermediary: This is the ‘program manager’ who lives in the United States and oversees the flow of services back and forth from a specific country. They will often guide the dossier completion, ensure the proper authentication of documents and maintain communication and direction with the foreign staff. They are responsible for submitting the dossier in the foreign country and coordinating the presentation of available children for placement. Foreign Staff: These are the professionals residing in the foreign country who facilitate all legal submission of documents and coordination and completion of United States Immigration requirements. These professionals may involve attorneys, social workers, orphanage guardians, etc. who live and work in that country for the international intermediary. This is the most expensive fee in an international adoption process and will vary country to country. These fees generally cover all facilitation and legal fees in the foreign country. STATE WARD: Adoptive parents seeking to adopt a state ward child (currently in foster care or a residential facility) are required to attend classes and training to gain a better understanding of the special needs of these children. Community mental health and educational supports must be strong and identified prior to a placement. The adoption process for state ward children, unfortunately, takes time and is often frustrating. Foster parents and those who have experience with special needs children are the best candidates to successfully adopt through this program. There are however, thousands of children across the United States; many are displayed through state adoption exchanges on the internet. There are no significant fees associated with the adoption of state ward children. Adoptive parents are expected to pay an application fee and a pre-placement assessment fee. The assessment fee, as well as other expenses that a prospective adoptive parent incurs, may be reimbursable upon the completion of the adoption. Most of the children available are also entitled to a subsidy payment until the age of 18 years. This non-taxable income is provided to meet the day-to-day expenses for a child. It is based on the child’s eligibility and needs, not the adoptive parent’s economic status."

The Adoption Study starts soon after the application materials are returned to the office.  The Adoption Study is usually completed in three (3) to four (4) months. Placement of a child with approved families usually occurs within 2-3 years.  Legal adoption can be initiated three (3) months after placement of a child with a family.  Catholic Charities cannot guarantee that a child will be placed with a family or that a family will be recommended as an adoptive family by the agency or be selected for a placement.  Catholic Charities will follow legal and ethical guidelines in completing home studies for adoption. Response Time: Completed applications should be returned within three (3) months of receipt.  If you need more time, please contact us."

Saint Paul is the capital of Minnesota and the second largest city in the state. Minnesota has a rich history of international adoption, having been one of the first states in the nation to have international adoption laws. There are many adoptive families in Minnesota and a large population of interracial families. Adoptive families residing in Minnesota are also fortunate to have the University of Minnesota International Adoption Clinic just across the river in Minneapolis and a wonderful resource network called MN Adopt (mnadopt.org), which is a non-profit program contracted by the Minnesota Department of Human Services dedicated to supporting and sustaining families who adopt by providing online resources and referrals to therapeutic and crisis services, support groups, adoption information, and comprehensive training opportunities.";"International Adoption Placement and Homestudy Services";"Step 1: If you reside in one of the states in which Hand In Hand has licensed offices (Arizona, Colorado, Florida, Indiana, or Minnesota) we invite you to attend a free orientation hosted by Hand In Hand. Our orientation sites, dates and times are listed on our news page, or you may contact the office nearest you for more information. If you reside in another state, you may request an information packet or contact our administrative office in Tucson, Arizona, and you will work directly with the Hand In Hand Program Director for your desired country. Step 2: If you choose to adopt through Hand In Hand, you must submit a completed application with application fee, a copy of your most recent tax return, a signed fee agreement for the specific country, a signed disclosure statement, and a snapshot photo of you and your family. Step 3: Upon receipt and acceptance of your application, Hand In Hand will send you an invitation to attend our mandatory pre-adoptive parent group training sessions (if you reside in Arizona, Colorado, Florida, Indiana or Minnesota). The agency requires 30-35 hours of training, with the structure of the training varying with the state. If you reside in a state other than Arizona, Colorado, Florida, Indiana or Minnesota, training will be provided by the licensed agency in your state that will be doing your home study. Areas of education provided by Hand In Hand include Immigration, the home study process, paperwork processing, types of children available, attachment and bonding, trans-racial and trans-cultural adoptions, medical considerations, core issues in adoption, parenting skills, and more. Step 4: With our guidance, you will be busy collecting medical reports, original birth certificates, marriage/divorce certificates, employment verification, physical examination forms, and other documents needed to build your dossier. Each country has its own requirements for dossier documents, and we will assist you with each one. Step 5: Once a portion of your required documents have been turned in, a home study will be scheduled with a licensed social worker. The home study visit is done in the informal atmosphere of your home. The home study is one of the pillars of the adoption case, as it goes to Immigration, your state of residence, and to the foreign country. If you reside in a state other than Arizona, Colorado, Florida, Indiana or Minnesota, you will locate a licensed agency in your state to complete the home study. If you need assistance or a list of possible agencies, Hand In Hand can help. Step 6: Upon dossier completion, Hand In Hand will complete all necessary legalizations and authentications of your documents. The dossier will then be sent to the respective country for review, acceptance and matching with a child. With a match, you will see pictures of the child and a case study (some countries provide a video of the child). Acceptance of the match is your decision. This is a lifetime commitment that you are making, and we want you to make the best decision for this child. If you need more time or have additional questions, we will work with the foreign country to attempt to get the answers for you. While you are making this decision, Hand In Hand is available to discuss any concerns or questions you may have or to discuss possible resources. Step 7: Upon match acceptance, the country is notified and the process is initiated for preparing to travel to get your child. The time frame from match acceptance to travel for placement will vary with each country. Step 8: A travel meeting will be scheduled with your Hand In Hand adoption specialist or program director. During this meeting, we will help you prepare for the trip, make travel arrangements, and understand the adoption finalization process. We have liaisons in each country with which we work who will meet you at the airport in the foreign country and assist you throughout your stay. Step 9: Finally! You will travel to the country to meet your child and will have the assistance of a representative, who will also help with the legal process in that country. Step 10: You and your wonderful child (or children) will head home with either a guardianship or a final decree of adoption, depending upon the host country. Step 11: A series of scheduled post placement visits and reports will be done by your social worker. The first visit is done within two weeks to one month after you return home. At this visit, we ask that you provide us with photos of your child to forward to the country with each required report. These post placement visits are meant to provide you with support, adjustment help, and finally to thank the country for making the decision to place the child internationally. When we show the foreign countries that adoptions are successful, it keeps the doors open for many more children to find their forever homes.  Step 12: Depending on the laws of your country and state, we ask that you go to court six or twelve months after returning home for the purpose of validating your child’s adoption in the U.S.  Step 13: We will assist you in obtaining a new birth certificate, a Social Security number, and citizenship documentation. Step 14: You’re ready to start again! And many of our families do, as close to 50% of families opt to adopt through Hand In Hand a second or even third time!"

The greatest effort spent on each couple will be the home study. A home study is a series of interviews in which the social worker concentrates on collecting information via face-to-face contact with each couple. The home study typically consists of an orientation interview followed by 4 home study interviews. 1. The first interview is a home visit in which the social worker will address each of the qualifications for adoption. This is a joint interview. 2. The next visits are individual interviews and are typically held at the LCS office. Both spouses may come on the same day, if they must travel to get to the office. If they are local, each spouse may schedule his or her own interview at his convenience. The interviews will be autobiographical in nature and will be based on an Autobiography written by the applicant. The social worker will ask that you complete this Autobiography prior to this interview. 3. The third interview will focus on parenting philosophies and plans. Issues such as experience and exposure to children, the applicants’ parenting received when they were children, values and discipline will be explored. 4. The fourth interview will focus on adoption education. We will discuss how to educate the child on his or her adoptive status, how to educate others, proper words and timing, books on adoption, trans-racial adoptions, contact with birth parents, background information on any prospective adopted child, completing a profile and many other issues common to adoption. Education is a very important part of the home study process. Each family in the domestic program is required to attend Lifeline’s domestic adoption conference in Birmingham, Alabama. This conference is a two day interactive training which will prepare and equip families for the joys and challenges of domestic adoption. After the home study process is completed, families will begin the matching process. Each family will create a family profile. Family profile’s are shown based on the birth mother’s preferences. Lifeline requires that at a minimum adoptive couples be willing to meet the birth mother before the adoption takes place, and to send correspondence through Lifeline to the birth family after the placement."

Established in 1994 through a grant from the Kellogg Foundation and incorporated in 1998, Mississippi Families for Kids is funded through individual donations, business contributions, Wendy’s franchisees, the Dave Thomas Foundation for Adoption, and through our annual Children’s Golf Classic. Mississippi Families for Kids was initiated to implement child focused, solution based, permanency-planning programs for the State of Mississippi. Top priority is given to those children who are presently in the adoption and foster care system.  The agency also serves those families who are at risk of coming into the child welfare system. Many of the children we serve are hard to place, such as older children, those with special needs, and those who have been abused, neglected, or abandoned. These children are often moved from foster home to foster home, which leads to a sense of instability and distrust.  Children coming from this kind of living situation often develop negative behaviors such as lying and stealing. These children are more likely to drop out of high school than other youth, commit violent crimes, have difficulty finding stable employment, frequently depend on public assistance as adults, and often find themselves homeless.

We provide you with information about the various types of adoption and help you decide the type of adoption best for you. You decide if you want to adopt a baby from Montana or another state or another country. Our agency provides written materials and a series of videos through our website which describe the process a couple goes through to adopt an infant from CSSM. They help to answer many questions such as: “What is open adoption? Who are the birth parents? How much does it cost to adopt through CSSM? What are the steps we need to go through and how long does it take?” We want you to be well informed  before you apply to be adoptive parents.You are invited to visit with the social worker whose office is closest to your home to have your individual questions answered. CSSM helps you to complete the home study process. If you adopt through the CSSM Adoption Program you create materials about your family that are provided to expectant parents. They choose the family for their baby or young child and social workers help you with the process of becoming acquainted and building a relationship. This support continues through the birth and beyond. The key to the success of CSSM’s over 61 years of Adoption is the support and compassion provided to everyone.

Children can be adopted through us, typically starting in foster care and working toward permanent adoption as the child stabilizes. We support families through all steps of the adoption process, often turning the case back to the State to help the family avoid unnecessary legal fees. We can provide adoptive home studies for families who plan to adopt through a private agency, including international adoptions. We also offer birth parent counseling and joint sessions with adoptive parents as needed.";"Adoption Services";"Adoption Process: Application - All adoptive parents – either in our program or through another agency – must submit an application. We charge a $100 processing fee for each adult in the home, and any reapplications will be charged at this rate. Home Study - Every adoptive family in Montana must have a special evaluation of their family before they can be matched with a child. This evaluation is called a “home study,” and our staff is trained to provide this service. If you’re adopting through another agency, we will need to contact your agency prior to beginning your home study. In this case, we are not the child placing agency and cannot provide legal services. The home study fee for families adopting through the Dan Fox Family Care Program is $300. The fee for other agency, national or international adoptions is $1,500. Parent Preparation - We require all our adoptive parents to complete a professional adoptive training program. This 30-hour program is offered three times a year in six-week sessions. Each session covers a different topic presented in various formats. Matching - We take the completed home study, along with a list of children waiting to be adopted, and work to make the best possible match between a child and family. This process can take time, but is essential in order for the adoption to be successful for both the child and your family. We only provide this service for adoptions handled through our program. Placement - Once we have found a suitable match, we will place the child with your family as a foster care placement prior to the legal finalization of the adoption. During that time, a trained social worker will work closely with your family to help the process run as smoothly as possible. Again, we only provide this service for adoptions through our program. Post-Adoptive Services - Once an adoption of a child is finalized, we are available to help with any problems and difficulties that might arise. We can teach you how to recognize when you need help and how to access needed services in our community. Families who adopt a child outside our program may purchase post-placement reviews and reports for a fee of $300 per review/report. Your agency may require additional reports. Other Adoption Services - We will make appropriate and authorized amendments to a home study written by our program for an additional fee of $35/hr. We will also provide an annual update for a $300 fee. For families pursuing adoption outside our program, we charge an additional $35 per hour for each request of a particular child."

Some families want to adopt because they are unable to have children biologically. Others have been made aware of older child adoption and want to give a safe, loving home to a child who dreams of normalcy. Regardless of where you might be on your journey, Child Saving Institute wants you to have an opportunity to learn about adoption and become more informed about the child for whom you might be the best adoptive parent. Here are just a few of the reasons Child Saving Institute has been a leader in placing children for adoption for more than 120 years: We are grounded in innovative national permanency practices, including open adoption, older child adoption, and post adoption support; CSI’s adoption specialists have received comprehensive training in helping you prepare for caring for children who have endured trauma. They are experts in attachment and are adept in evidence-based practices to help you prepare your family for a new (perhaps older) addition; We are there for you providing the support you need throughout the entire process - from licensing and timely home study completion to identifying children who might be the best fit for your family. In addition, we offer ongoing education and support during the placement phase all the way through finalization. Child Saving Institute’s adoption philosophies are based on the following beliefs: We focus on the best interests of the child when finding a Forever Family for the child; Every child has the right to a permanent, nurturing, and safe family; The agency is legally, morally, and ethically responsible for trying to place children in homes where they will have the opportunity to develop healthy self-concepts and receive the physical and emotional nurturing they need to develop their full potential. As you open your hearts to the possibility of adoption, we hope you’ll rely on us to answer your many questions about adoption and the children currently waiting for loving families. No matter where your adoption journey may take you, Child Saving Institute hopes to be a part of it as a resource for information, education, and support.";"Adoption Services";

Prequalification - Determining your eligibility as an adoptive applicant is the first step. Do you meet basic requirements for adoption in Nevada? Are there any concerns that would prevent your homestudy from being approved? It is best for everyone involved to address these items up front; you have the peace of mind to know you are in a good position to begin the process, and we know that you are a good candidate for our program. Create a user account by clicking the “Apply Now” link in the Adoption Services section at www.catholiccharities.com to create a MyAdoptionPortal account. Please be thorough in all paperwork. Additional supporting items may be required for your background disclosures. 2. Orientation - Orientation offers an introduction to the basic adoption process, an overall introduction to adoption concepts, types of adoption, legalities and more. Presentation of the “family building partnership” offers specific CCSN program information. Attendance at an orientation by each adoptive applicant is required for agency program acceptance. Please Note: You must attend an Orientation session and complete all required documentation on MyAdoptionPortal in order to be prequalified for adoption through Catholic Charities. 3. Homestudy - Application materials are completed online with references, medical exams, law enforcement clearances and other supporting documentation. Individual and joint interviews are conducted during visits to the adoptive family’s home. 4. Prospective Match - A match is made based on several factors: birthparent(s) circumstances and preferences along with adoptive parent’s preferences. The birthparent(s) or the agency may determine the adoptive family. The adoptive family is provided with non-identifying information and determines if they are comfortable moving forward. This may occur during a birthmother’s pregnancy or after a child is born. Depending upon the birthparent’s desires, this may include meeting the birthparent(s), providing birthparent assistance (facilitated by the agency), being involved in the pregnancy and/or the labor and delivery. 5. Placement - In accordance with Nevada statute and all parties continued agreement with the adoption plan, the placement of the child is made.

After completion of the home study interviews and all documents are received including the results of the criminal history check, approval can be given and the couple is notified that they have been placed on our waiting list. Note: Couples on waiting list must have their home study updated after 18 months and re-approved before placement of a child. 3.
