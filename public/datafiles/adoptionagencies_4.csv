;"Adoption Assistance Agency";"Licensed";"2800 Eubank Blvd. NE";"Albuquerque";"NM";" 87112";(505) 821-7779;;;;;;"http://www.adoptionassistance.org/";"Adoption Assistance Agency exists to help children join families who will love, nurture, protect and embrace them for a lifetime. We believe it is our heavenly Father who creates families and we have seen Him faithfully create so many loving adoptive families. Our non-profit identity enables us to raise charitable funds to accomplish many signifant and worthwhile goals. The first is to defray the costs of birthmothers who plan an adoption and then change their mind. This enables the adoptive family to have their birthmother expense fee apply to another adoption, rather than losing that fee. In addition to helping children find their loving families, we strive to help families of limited means through charitable funds who can only have children through the expensive option of adoption. We offer nurturing, education, counseling, and support for families struggling to overcome challenges. We provide community education for those working with women so that women who become pregnant may have access to full information and make loving, life-giving choices for their children. Women and men who make the courageous and loving choice of placing their child for adoption through Adoption Assistance can receive counseling for issues related to the adoption until the child is 18 as long as the agency is in business. ";"Adoption Services";"Adoption Process for Adoptive Parents: All people wanting to adopt an unrelated child must have a Pre-Placement Study (also called homestudy). Sometimes relatives and stepparents must also have a Pre-Placement Study to adopt a child. It is best to check with a licensed adoption agency, licensed adoption provider or an attorney to see if a Pre-Placement Study is needed. Only agencies and individuals appropriately educated and licensed to provide adoption services may do Pre-Placement Studies, matching for adoption, birthparent counseling and post placement supervision of an adoption. A normal agency adoption by a NM family of a child born in New Mexico through Adoption Assistance Agency, is about $20,500, which includes the application fee, the Pre-Placement Study, the Listing Fee, the Birthmother Expense Fee and the Placement Fee. It does not include legal fees. A Pre-Placement Study takes about 3-4 months to complete. The family has some control over part of the time frame for the homestudy. If approved through the Pre-Placement Study process, the adoptive family will prepare a photo album to be used to introduce them to prospective birthparents. They will be able to view other albums and will determine what pictures and information to share in the album. Birthparents typically select the adoptive family they want for their child. When the adoptive families undergo the homestudy, they are asked what ethnicities they wish to accept and what level of openness with the birthparents they desire. The birthparents (most often the birthmother) are shown the albums of approved adoptive families that match what she is looking for in a family and for whom she is a good match. Since birthparents select the adoptive parents, AAA does not have control over the waiting time to be matched. It could be weeks up to about 2 years. It is best for families to emotionally prepare themselves for a wait of at least 14-15 months, since many families wait this length of time and it is better to plan for longer than to think it will happen right away. We do limit our approved and waiting adoptive family pool to about 20 families. This is the only way we can help assure that no family will wait a really long time. Adoptive parents are notified when they are chosen and are given all of the information that has been obtained on the birthmother and the prospective adoptee. However, it is not possible to have complete medical and historical information on the birthparents at that time. The provision of medical and historical information on the birthparent/s and the child is ongoing as information is obtained. AAA is committed to providing all of the obtainable medical and social background information on the birthparent/s and adoptee to the adoptive family. Open adoption refers to some level of ongoing contact between the birthparent and the adoptive family. It can be as minimal as meeting one time before the birth to meeting on a regular basis. It is NOT co-parenting and should never compromise the ability of the adoptive parents to parent their child. It can refer to only letters and pictures provided to the birthparent/s from the adoptive parents or could involve letters and pictures going both directions. The level of openness and the specific arrangements are determined through a negotiation process through the caseworker. The Adoption Process from the Birthparent Perspective: COUNSELING - One hour session mandated by law.  Average birthmother receives 4 hours of adoption counseling and the average birthfather receives about 2 hours as that is all they are usually available for.  We like to provide more counseling but it is at the request of the birthparent and is discretionary. ADOPTION FACILITATION - Time spent walking a client through various procedures with support.  Examples:  applying for Medicaid, procuring living arrangements, meeting the adoptive family, negotiating open adoption issues, facilitating meeting with attorney for independent legal counsel, transportation/support at hospital/labor & delivery, support for relinquishment process, etc. DOCUMENTS. FOLLOW UP - Follow up with the birthparent is supportive in nature and is at the discretion of the birthparent. Follow up with the adoptive family is called Post Placement Supervision and will be conducted through phone calls and visits to the adoptive home with an assessment of the attachment and bonding occurring between the adoptive family and the adoptee, as well as an assessment of the physical, emotional, and mental care, nurturing and progress of the adoptee.  Near the end of the Post Placement period which normally lasts an average of 4-6 months, but which can vary for a number of reasons, a Post Placement Report for the Court is prepared summarizing the findings of the Post Placment Supervision."

It’s not so much about finding a child for a family, but rather it’s about finding the most suitable family for each waiting child. “Special needs” is a phrase used to classify children who, for various reasons, have a harder time finding families willing to adopt them. Often special needs include factors such as age, background, and physical, mental, or emotional challenges. Children may also be classified as special needs if they are part of a sibling group that is being placed for adoption together, or members of a minority group.

They need the nurturing and support that a permanent family can provide, and they deserve a chance to grow up feeling secure and loved. That is where special needs adoption comes into play. It’s not so much about finding a child for a family, but rather it’s about finding the most suitable family for each waiting child. “Special needs” is a phrase used to classify children who, for various reasons, have a harder time finding families willing to adopt them. Often special needs include factors such as age, background, and physical, mental, or emotional challenges. Children may also be classified as special needs if they are part of a sibling group that is being placed for adoption together, or members of a minority group. Typically, the children placed for adoption by Children’s Village are considered special needs.";"Adoption Services";

Today, Spence-Chapin is proud of our role as a prominent voice and leading advocate for adoption, and of our commitment to the well being of all members of the adoption triad: birth parents, adoptive parents, and their children.";"Adoption and Adoption-Related Services";

Providing services to children whose birth parents are unable to care for them has been central to our mission since our founding over 75 years ago. Our community-based foster care services serve thirteen community districts in Brooklyn, the Bronx, and Manhattan. Children in our care are placed in loving, stable homes as we work with their birth families to resolve the issues that brought their children into care. When children are unable to return home and the court has determined that adoption is the next step, we work to find a permanent home through adoption. In many cases, the child’s foster family is able to adopt them. When that is not possible, we must then find a loving adoptive home. Children in our care receive a comprehensive range of services including: medical screenings, mental health evaluations and services, developmental screenings and referrals, groups for teens, and case management. All children deserve safe, nurturing permanent families who can provide an unconditional, lasting commitment to them. Our charge is to make that happen. We engage a network of support, inclusive of community and family members, to empower birth parents to successfully and safely reunify their families and, to reduce the length of time that their children spend in foster care. We will also work closely with birth parents to identify individuals within their own families or social networks who can be a resource for their child.

Once the packet is returned, an approval committee reviews each application. 3. If approved, a pre-placement assessment (also called a home study) packet will be sent. The home study process is guided by the state of North Carolina’s requirements for paperwork and interviews. The home study packet will include documents such as medical forms, birth and marriage certificates, criminal record checks, health insurance verification, and financial information. Once all documentation has been received by AGA, a social worker contacts the family to begin the interview process. Three meetings are required. 4. Once the home study has been completed and approved, it is valid for 18 months. This means an adoptive placement can be made during that period of time. Each family puts together a profile book, or photo album, about their lives. These books are shown to birthparents, who choose the adoptive family and may request a meeting with the family. These meetings are usually held in the AGA office and inevitably serve to remove fears and calm nerves of all parties involved. 5. At the time of placement, physical custody of the child is given to the adoptive family, even though Amazing Grace Adoptions temporarily maintains legal custody. Two post-placement supervisory visits are required by North Carolina before finalization can be completed. The first of these occurs during the first two weeks following placement."

We provide services to 46 counties in the western region of North Carolina.  We welcome families of all faiths and ethnicities.  We believe that every child deserves to have a family to guide them through life.  It is important to know that as you build your family through adoption, your journey does not end with the placement of a child.  Our professional staff will provide ongoing support, guidance and education to all members of the adoption circle for a lifetime. We are available to provide comprehensive services as well as contractual services. As you explore adoption through Catholic Charities, you will find a variety of options and a sliding fee scale that will meet your family’s needs.  ";"General Adoption Information; Post Adoption Placement Support; Confidential Intermediary Services";"Domestic Adoption: The first step in our adoption process is to contact the adoption social worker to schedule a face to face consultation. During this visit you will learn more about adoption and our process. We will provide you with the application and you will have the opportunity to ask the very important questions that will help you make the best plan for your family. In North Carolina, every family that adopts must have an approved pre-placement assessment. The assessment is the process by which the family engages with Catholic Charities staff to determine the readiness and preparedness to become an adoptive family. A key element of this process is the preparation of the family for placement including education, support and contact with other adoptive families. The assessment is completed within 90 days of the date your application is accepted for the pre-placement assessment process. Once your pre-placement assessment has been completed and approved you are ready for the next steps in your adoption journey. You will complete a parent profile that can be shared with expectant parents. Waiting time varies per family and placement is not guaranteed.

Once a family’s dossier (the set of documents representing a family to the authorities in Nepal) has been submitted, the match between prospective parents and child is made by the Matching Committee of the Ministry of Women, Children and Social Welfare. Frank Adoption Center is given fairly detailed information regarding how the child came into care, their medical status and their social history. We anticipate the time between dossier submission and match to be 3-6 months, though the wait time may be longer for families interested in adopting younger children. Once a family has accepted their child’s referral, the process will begin towards adoption finalization in Nepal. Frank Adoption Center will also begin working with the family and the US Embassy to complete the I600 and I604 investigation (investigations conducted by the US Embassy to ensure children are truly orphans or have been formally relinquished by birth family with a clear understanding of what international adoption means for them and their child). Families will not travel until these are complete. We anticipate the time from referral to travel to be 6-10 months. Families should anticipate a 10 day stay in Nepal."

Once it is clear that you desire to make an adoption plan, you can choose to look at profiles designed by the adoptive families who are waiting for a child. At this point you can pick a family for your child. If you would rather the agency pick the family, we will choose the family that’s been waiting the longest and is the best match for all involved. We will also work with you in deciding whether you would prefer an open, semi-open, or closed adoption. Until you have signed the papers surrendering your parental rights to your child (“Relinquishment papers”) you can change your mind. You will never be pressured to make a decision that is not right for you. And even then, there is a seven-day “Revocation period” in North Carolina in which you can change your mind about your decision and have your child returned to you. If you decide to make an adoption plan, your counselor will inform you of what steps you would need to take if you do change your mind and decide to parent. A New Life works with an adoption attorney who has years of experience in adoption law. There are several means of terminating the rights of a birthfather who is uninvolved or unconcerned about the child. Additionally, there are steps we can take in terminating the rights of a birthfather about whom you do not have much information. Some birthfathers are supportive of and involved in the adoption planning and choosing of the adoptive family and others are simply willing to sign the Relinquishment papers. If the birthfather is involved he may also choose an open, semi-open or closed adoption agreement. Our agency abides by the law to ensure that once the baby is placed with its adoptive parents after the revocation period, that child’s life will not be disrupted in any way and will enjoy the peace of mind you intended for them. Typically, by the time you go to the hospital to deliver, there is a plan and completed paperwork allowing our agency to begin putting your plan in motion. While in the hospital you may choose whether you will see or hold the baby. The hospital time is a time for you to say goodbye in the way that will give you greatest peace of mind.

We are a 501(c)3 Non Profit Adoption Agency. We look to serve Christian adoptive parents whom we believe will raise their adopted children to know Christ. We have assisted our parents with adoptions from Poland (and Bulgaria) for over 15 years.  We are truly thankful to have been given the opportunity to dedicate our professional lives to serve our parents. Since we began working, per God’s grace, we are blessed to report that we have been able to witness over 180 (4 more included as of June 25, 2015) children adopted by our parents.  We are thankful for this experience because with every adoption, we are able to better serve our parents yet to come. We love being able to pour out our knowledge, acquired from our many years of experience, to make the experience of our adoptive parents, whom we had committed to serve, easier.  We have all of the credentials necessary to serve our adoptive parents including: License in North Carolina allowing us to serve families from any state; COA Hague Accreditation; Polish Hague Accreditation; Bulgarian Hague Accredited Partner. Accreditations and licenses are wonderful accomplishments and we are blessed to have been given that opportunity.  However, these things are something that all agencies must have in order to provide services.  Therefore, these alone, since all agencies have them, should not be the reason why you select your agency. We open heartedly recommend that you find the people within an agency that you will like working with; the people whom you will be able to trust to guide you through this process. We know it’s not always easy for adoptive parents getting started. We know the questions adoptive parents ask themselves before deciding to start and we understand their thoughts as they go through the process. Though we know and understand, we don’t claim to have all the answers.  We do believe that as Christians we are called to adopt.  If that is so, and if God is with us, we don’t need to have all the answers all at once.  Rather, all we need to do is take the first step and pray for when the next step is due. Though we can’t answer all questions, there are plenty we can answer about the process of adopting from Poland, so if you feel like you are ready to take the a step – just to learn more - we’d love to tell you.

Children are involved in creating their “life books” with staff and other skilled professionals such as their therapist and DSS workers. Children receive therapy that is treatment focused to prepare them for adoption. The children receiving these services are currently housed with other children receiving a variety of treatments. These children are still working on attachment issues and the Yahweh Center wants to help these children transition into competent loving family environments. Many times potential families can begin the process of unification while the children are working out their issues. Our agency specializes in children with RAD (reactive attachment disorder) condition and can help families deal with issues related to the disorder by offering training, counseling, and other services. In addition to Adoption Services, the Yahweh Center offers MAPP Classes ( Model Approach to Partnerships in Parenting ) to help parents learn effective communication and interaction with these children. Our agency is currently looking for 3 to 5 Families that are willing to be trained and certified as therapeutic foster parents. These families provide children a place to transition from group care to home care. The Yahweh Center is a licensed Mental Health provider and licensed also by the North Carolina Division of Social Services in providing child-placing services. Home studies and pre and post adoption services are offered.";"Adoption Services";

Through B&GH foster-to-adopt agency, you can adopt a child at no cost to you. While each child in need of adoption has a unqiue background, the children who come to us - from infants to teenagers - have been identified by area Department of Social Services as abused, neglected, abandoned or dependent. When a child is available for adoption through B&GH, it is because reunification with the birth family is not possible and the parental rights have been either terminated or are in the process of being terminated. Adoptive parents may be married or single, but must be over 21 years old. Also, they must have their own means of transportation, a telephone, high school diploma/GED and have sufficient income to meet the needs of their own families. Because we are a foster-to-adopt agency, all potential adoptive parents must first complete MAPP’S GPS training and become licensed foster parents. B&GH does not deny any person the opportunity to become a foster/adoptive parent on the basis of race, color, national origin of the person or child involved. There are no agency fees affiliated with the recruitment, training and licensing of adoptive homes and the placement of children within these homes. Financially, most adopted children are eligible for state adoption assistance, tax benefits, and Medicaid coverage until 18 years of age. Adopted children, age 12 and above, are eligible for tuition benefits for 4 years of college. We provide pre and post adoption services, 24/7 availability and access to support groups.

Traditional foster care is available for youths who have minimal or no mental health needs. Adoptions are an opportunity for our agency to provide a forever family for children and teens in need. The child’s age and other criteria determine the length of time it takes to match the child to a home.  Most of the children are school age and are currently living in foster homes.

The greatest effort spent on each couple will be the home study. A home study is a series of interviews in which the social worker concentrates on collecting information via face-to-face contact with each couple. The home study typically consists of an orientation interview followed by 4 home study interviews. 1. The first interview is a home visit in which the social worker will address each of the qualifications for adoption. This is a joint interview. 2. The next visits are individual interviews and are typically held at the LCS office. Both spouses may come on the same day, if they must travel to get to the office. If they are local, each spouse may schedule his or her own interview at his convenience. The interviews will be autobiographical in nature and will be based on an Autobiography written by the applicant. The social worker will ask that you complete this Autobiography prior to this interview. 3. The third interview will focus on parenting philosophies and plans. Issues such as experience and exposure to children, the applicants’ parenting received when they were children, values and discipline will be explored. 4. The fourth interview will focus on adoption education. We will discuss how to educate the child on his or her adoptive status, how to educate others, proper words and timing, books on adoption, trans-racial adoptions, contact with birth parents, background information on any prospective adopted child, completing a profile and many other issues common to adoption. Education is a very important part of the home study process. Each family in the domestic program is required to attend Lifeline’s domestic adoption conference in Birmingham, Alabama. This conference is a two day interactive training which will prepare and equip families for the joys and challenges of domestic adoption. After the home study process is completed, families will begin the matching process. Each family will create a family profile. Family profile’s are shown based on the birth mother’s preferences. Lifeline requires that at a minimum adoptive couples be willing to meet the birth mother before the adoption takes place, and to send correspondence through Lifeline to the birth family after the placement."

Apply to Adoption Link. 2. Meet with an Adoption Link social worker to complete your homestudy (typically, one visit in the family home and one visit at the Adoption Link office). As part of the Homestudy process Adoption Link connects adoptive applicants to online training as well as reading materials on various topics. 3. Continue to gather all your homestudy documents. 4. Complete your Adoptive Family Profile. This is the document we will share with birthparents when they are selecting a family. It may be a photo book, like the do-it-yourself kind widely available online. It may also be a four-page 8.5 x 11 booklet. The booklet is a less expensive option, but, because it is layed out by a professional graphic designer, it can generally accommodate every photo and all the text you'd like to include. Booklets are easier for our social workers to carry to birthparents and allow the birthparents to get to know you quickly, but thoroughly.  Whether you opt for a book or a booklet, make color copies and hold onto your original. Provide Adoption Link with copies. Birthparents will keep the document of the family that they select. 5. Network on your own. Contact everyone you know that you want to adopt. Tell your pastor, your drycleaner, your best friend, all your friends - everyone! 6. Get matched with a birthparent. A birthparent has asked to meet with your family and the meeting goes well. You're matched! 7. Your baby is born! 8. Placement of the baby occurs after the birthparent(s) have signed the surrender agreement, usually at 72 hours after birth. Adoption Link holds custody until you go to court at six months to finalize your adoption. 9. Post-Placement Visits: While you are waiting to finalize, your family meets with an Adoption Link social worker monthly."

Over the past 19 years Agape for Youth, Inc. has built a strong reputation in the community as a leader in quality therapeutic foster care. Over the years Agape has expanded its services to include family foster care, providing adoption home studies, preparation of families and children for adoption, and supportive services to adoptive families. Agape offers adoption services as a part of our foster care program in order to provide care to our foster children who no longer can reunify with their biological family. This past year, all adoptions taking place through Agape for Youth, Inc. were foster children being adopted by their foster family. Individuals who are open to fostering children can gain experience in caring for special needs children. In the event that a foster child cannot reunify with their biological family member, foster parents often become the preferred adoptive placement option. Adoption through foster care is a way to start off the parenting experience positively since the adoptive parent and child have an opportunity to get acquainted and build a relationship while the child is in foster care.Agape provides a variety of adoption services including adoption homestudy, parent education classes, adoption preparation, placement and post-placement support. Agape focuses on serving families in the counties of southwest Ohio so that we are able to provide the support needed for a successful foster care and adoption experience. Agape for Youth, Inc. also is qualified to complete private adoption homestudies for a fee for those families who are contracting with an out of state child placing agency for the purpose of adoption.";"Adoption Services: Adoption Homestudy, Parent Education Classes, Adoption Preparation, Placement and Post-Placement Support; Foster Care; Reunification Services";
