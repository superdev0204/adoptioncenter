As reunification is not always possible for children placed in our care, Permanency Partners can assist our foster parents in adopting foster children whose natural parents’ rights have been terminated. As a licensed affiliate of the Statewide Adoption Network (SWAN), Permanency Partners, a Division of Children’s Home of York, offers adoption services that are funded and overseen by the Department of Public Welfare. Many children in Pennsylvania’s state foster care system are waiting for families. Aged 0 to 18, they are considered to be “special needs” children because they may have experienced neglect or abuse, they may be older (aged 8 to 18), they may be of a racial minority or part of a sibling group that needs to be placed together. Do you believe that every child deserves a family? So do we! Permanency Partners is committed to recruiting and preparing families to adopt the children who wait for homes in foster care. Our adoptions are state-funded, so adoptive parents pay no agency fee. In addition, we provide training to prepare our families and children for the adoption process, assist in obtaining available medical subsidies and financial assistance, and provide post-adoption services such as respite care, adoptive parent support groups and case management services. Children’s Home of York adoption services matches area children of all ages who are in need of homes with Pennsylvania families. We pair the right child with the right family through a variety of processes including family and child profiling and working with county children and youth agencies to connect waiting children and families for the purpose of adoption. Children’s Home of York employs a team approach to set long-term goals with the child and family. Admission and the provision of services are made without regard to race, color, national origin, religion, sexual orientation or disability. Children who have serious untreated drug/alcohol addictions, those with violent and assaultive behaviors or a history of fire setting and those who are actively psychotic may not be appropriate for referral.";"Adoption Education and Training Programs; Transitional Services from Foster Care to Adoption;  Pre-Adoption Counseling; Adoption Resource Library; Child Profiles; Child Preparation; Child-Specific Recruitment including Family Findings; Family Profiles and Home Studies; Placement Services including Post Adoption Contact Agreements; Post Placement Supervision and Finalization; Post-Permanency Assessments; Post Permanency Case Advocacy; Post Permanency Support Groups; Post Permanency Respite";

FCS is a licensed affiliate of the Statewide Adoption and Permanency Network (SWAN). For families who want to adopt, be kinship parents, or provide permanent legal custodianship, we will help you complete a home study, also known as a Family Profile. In addition to the application and paperwork that is required, there is also a preparation and training element to the Family Profile, which we provide. Once your Family Profile is approved, we use a variety of methods to help match you with a child, facilitate a child’s placement with your family, and assist you through the Adoption Finalization process. If you have already adopted or are providing kinship care or are a legal custodian of a child, you are eligible to receive Post-Permanency services. These services are to help families preserve healthy functioning and relationships or to help obtain services to benefit any member of the family. Case Management/Advocacy, Respite, and Support Group are available through SWAN and can be provided by FCS. Requests for Post-Permanency services need to be made directly through SWAN by calling 1-800-585-SWAN (7926). In addition to providing services for families, FCS also provides SWAN services to children and adolescents prior to their permanency. A Child Profile is a comprehensive summary of a child’s life. It’s purpose is to provide a written history of the child’s life and family, which can benefit the child’s identity development and be used as a reference for health history, etc. The Child Profile is made available to adoptive families so they know the child’s background and can make informed decisions about the child’s care. Child Preparation is a service that assists children and adolescents in developing a Life Book and can help them work through issues that might be a barrier to finding permanency. Child Specific Recruitment aids in permanency through finding adoptive resources and/or other permanent supports and connections. FCS can also provide home studies for private adoptions. The process is similar to that of the Family Profile, but the training requirements are different. While Family Profiles are funded through SWAN, private home studies cost $2,400.

Case management services are provided once placement occurs to ensure the success of the family prior to finalization. Families take a 10-week intensive therapeutic curriculum that helps the child and the adoptive family understand issues related to placement, including the impact of abuse, neglect, separation and trauma, and issues related to permanency, including adoption. Post Permanency Services include case advocacy services, respite services, and support groups.";"Adoption Services";

Thousands more are waiting. This could be your first ever glance into international adoption, or you may know just about everything there is to know about it, but be it the former or the latter - you are a hero in our eyes. Every day we work hard to find families for children, and everyone who opens their heart, who shares their love, who welcomes a child into their family is both a hero, and a parent. Being a parent doesn’t get enough credit lately, but it should. Being a good parent is hard work, but that eternal bond that you build with your child, that sparkle in her eyes when she talks to you, that feeling of being a family is what makes it all worth it. That is what our families tell us, and that is what makes us work even harder every day. We know that there are more children waiting, and there are more parents anxious to fill that void in their heart, and they trust us to help them find each other. Children depend on us. You depend on us. We never take that trust for granted.";"International Adoptions: Bulgarian Program; Georgia Program; Latvia Program; Ukraine Program";"Bulgarian Adoption Process: Step 1. Talk to us. Step 2. Home study. Step 3. Getting documents together. Step 4. Working with the Bulgarian side. Step 5. Waiting for referral. Step 6. Accepting referral, meeting your child, and more paperwork. Step 7. Court, and more. Step 8. There and back - This is it, home stretch. You need to fly to Bulgaria, meet with your child, get all of the paperwork, go to the US Embassy there to get a visa (follow the procedure, which also includes a medical exam of the child), and once all of your documents are in order... FLY HOME!; Georgia Adoption Process: Step 1. Give us a call. Step 2. Send us your application. Step 3. Home study. Step 4. Getting documents together for your registration package. Step 5. Getting a referral. Step 6. Travel. Step 7. Finalize the adoption; Latvian Adoption Process: Step 1: Submit your application. Step 2: Get your Hague home study. Step 3: Documents Step 4: Referral. Step 5: First trip - Now things get really exciting! Before it was us, phones, and paperwork, but now you get to travel to Latvia to meet with your prospective adoptive child. Latvia established a 3 week bonding period, during which you and the child spend time together. We will arrange for the Orphan Court approved accommodations (safe for the child), where you will stay with the child, and where you’ll be visited by the social worker. This social worker will observe your interactions with the child and make a determination if this adoption is in the best interest of the child. Also, this is when the Latvian Court decides if it is going to grant you a permission to continue your pre-adoption care period for your child in the United States. If their decision is positive, you’ll be able to travel back home with your prospective adoptive child. Step 6: Back in the USA - You are back home and your prospective adoptive child is with you. It’s not the end though, but it’s a good midpoint for the process. Now you (well, us) will work on some forms for the USCIS and get you a provisional approval. Step 7: Back to Latvia, one parent goes for the hearing. Now, this is when the Latvian court makes their decision. This would be like a court hearing in any other process, except that your kid is already home. Only one parent needs to fly in, go to the hearing, and then go back home. Court decision is in effect 20 days after that. Latvian side needs another 15 to 20 days to get all of your documents ready. Step 8: Back to Latvia one last time, US Embassy, and coming home for good. This is your final trip back to Latvia. This time, though, at least one parent has to go, and both parents can, and your prospective adoptive child needs to travel back to Latvia to get a visa to come back to the United States. Your child must attend an appointment at the US Embassy in Latvia in order to get a visa to enter the United States again. So, travel to Latvia, get the paperwork, go to the US Embassy, follow the procedure, get the entry visa, fly back to the United States, and upon landing give us a call - we’ll be waiting.; Ukraine Adoption Process: Step 1: Talk to us. Step 2: Send us your application. Step 3: Homestudy. Step 4: Dossier. Step 5: Referrals and being matched with the child. Step 6: Adoption in Ukraine. Step 7: The US Embassy in Ukraine, USCIS, and Department of Homeland Security. Step 8: Going home."
