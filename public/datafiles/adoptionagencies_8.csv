For those wishing to explore adoption, we are a licensed adoption agency and can provide the proper counseling and opportunities to select a family for her child. We see the adoptive family as an extension of Christ to minister His love to the birth family placing their baby for adoption.  We are also committed to the Biblical directive to raise children to know and love the Lord, therefore, we place children for adoption only with professing Christian couples who have been married at least three years and are active members of the same church. Our goal would be to place babies in homes where they will be raised according to the Word of God and come to the understanding of their need for redemption in Christ with the hope that they will become believers.

We guide adoptive families through the home study and legal process and train them so they’re prepared to bring a child into their home. And of course a lot of what we offer is support for the process they’re going through. We also provide counseling for the birth mother during and after her pregnancy. When she needs help that extends beyond six weeks after delivery, we connect her to a PCHAS Child and Family specialist. We provide housing, medical care, and other necessities through this program. Most of the adoptions we facilitate are open adoptions, meaning the birth parents select and meet future adoptive parents. If they would like, and they feel comfortable doing so, birthparents can maintain a close relationship with their birth child throughout the years. This can include contacts such as personal visits, pictures, letters and telephone calls. An open adoption benefits both birth families and adoptive families. Children can never have too many people to love them. Therefore, having an open adoption enables children to know their birthparents and learn more about their family history. While most adoptions today are open, in the past, the records were usually sealed. Adults who were adopted as children often ask us to help them search for and reunite them with their birth parents. This process involves counseling for all parties. In a typical year, we help more than 100 families in the Search and Reunion program.;Adoption;

Adoption agency staff members work with birth-parents, who, for whatever reason, are unable or unwilling to provide a stable home environment. Plans are carefully developed to provide for a child with a prospective adoptive family. Adoptive families are carefully evaluated by staff and prepared to receive children when the need arises. Birth-parents may participate in the selection and match of the child to prospective adoptive families. When appropriate, de-identified information is shared with birth-parents, agency staff, and adoptive parents, who all participate in the placement decision. The adoption program is licensed and monitored by the Texas Department of Family and Protective Services as a nonprofit Child Placing Agency. Infants and toddlers accepted for adoption are placed with the agency voluntarily by birth-parents at birth or shortly thereafter, usually before a child reaches one year old. Adoptive placements occur only after the agency has taken the legal steps necessary to qualify a child for adoption. ;Adoption;A formal application is completed by prospective adoptive parents and submitted to the agency, along with copies of marriage certificates, income statements, insurance policies, and references. A home study is conducted and interviews are held with each family member. Once approved, prospective adoptive parents complete written profiles that are de-identified and available for birth-parents to review. This process is intended to provide birth-parents with general information about the interests and qualities of approved families awaiting placement of children. Birth-parents are then able to provide the agency staff with input toward making a match between their child and the adoptive family. After children are placed in the adoptive home, counseling and supervision are offered regularly for six months until such time that the adoptive parents meet the legal requirements to petition the court for legal adoption.

Box 1655;Grapevine;TX;76099;(972) 854-2935;;;;;joy@dillonadopt.com;https://www.dillonadopt.com/;Dillon International was founded by Jerry and Deniese Dillon in 1972 to meet the needs of the thousands of vulnerable Korean orphans. Centrally located in the United States, Dillon International is based in Tulsa, Oklahoma, and was the first licensed international adoption agency in the state. Throughout our history, Dillon International has been actively involved in establishing intercountry adoption standards and policies both in the United States and abroad. The agency has helped to establish adoption programs in several countries, including a model foster care program in Korea. Each participating country in the agency’s adoption program has invited Dillon International to help find homes for their vulnerable children. Since our beginning, Dillon International has placed over 6,000 children from developing countries with loving, adoptive families in the United States. Several hundred additional children have been placed with families in their country of birth as a result of Dillon’s efforts. In addition, Dillon International has helped to underwrite hospitals, orphanages and schools in Korea, India, China, and most recently in Vietnam.;Adoption;"APPLICATION: This allows our agency to get acquainted with your family and determine if your  family meets the requirements for our agency and the U.S. government. We will help you determine which intercountry programs you qualify for, since each of the foreign countries has varying requirements. PRE-ADOPTION WORKSHOP: This is a required online course that prepares your family for what to expect throughout the adoption process, with particular focus on country-specific family requirements  and procedures. This course must be completed prior to receiving the Home Study Application. HOME STUDY APPLICATION: This is a collection of documents and information about your family that is required based on state, U.S. and foreign government regulations. The application helps us get to know you better, assists the social worker’s preparation of the home study, and helps your family “rehearse” for dossier preparation. Criminal background and child abuse checks are initiated at this time. The Home Study Application cannot be processed until all requested documents and copies are received. U.S. CITIZEN & IMMIGRATION SERVICES: USCIS determines each family’s eligibility and suitability to adopt a child from a foreign country. The process begins with your family filing the I-600A application (non-Hague adoption) or the I-800A application (Hague adoption) with USCIS. We will provide your family with instructions for filing either form after Application Part 2 is approved. USCIS will inform your family of the location and date to have fingerprints taken for a FBI criminal background check. If approved, USCIS will send your family an approval notice. The I-600A is valid for 18 months; the I-800A is valid for 15 months. Your family must renew either form filed as many times as necessary to ensure the USCIS approval is valid at the time the child’s U.S. visa is issued. INTERNATIONAL ADOPTION SEMINAR: This provides your family an in-depth learning opportunity to explore issues relevant for intercountry adoption and adoptive families and helps your family build realistic expectations for both the adoption experience and the child joining your family.  Topics include: attachment, grief and loss, medical issues, impact of institutionalization and environment on child development, talking to your child about adoption, racial and cultural identity, initial adjustments and more. Your family must complete the seminar prior to completing your home study. Completion of the seminar helps fulfill the USCIS and Hague Treaty requirement for pre-adoption counseling and education. This is an online class available on www.dillonadopt.com. HOME STUDY: This is an evaluation of your family, which is requested after the Home Study Application has been approved. A social worker usually has two to four visits with your family, including a home visit to get to know you, your parenting styles, your resources, and your reasons for adopting. The intent of the home study is to assess your family’s readiness and suitability to adopt a child. The Home Study also helps educate and prepare your family for the adoption experience and the child joining your family. The social worker will submit a current home study in compliance with the require ments set up by your state of residence, U.S. government and the foreign country.  Our Agency will provide the social worker with guidelines for preparing your home study and will review your home study to ensure it complies with requirements. DOSSIER: Once your family’s home study is completed, your family will prepare a dossier for submission to the foreign country you have chosen (with the exception of Korea). The dossier is a set of legal documents, which includes your family’s home study and provides information, which helps foreign government officials in determining if your family meets the country’s requirements for adopting a child. We review your family’s dossier documents to ensure they meet country requirements. Depending on the country, our staff may also process the documents and obtain authentication or apostille certificates. CHILD REFERRAL: Our Agency receives information on a child from the foreign country. The child’s information is then presented to your family by your home study social worker or an agency representative. Referral information will include one or more photos of the child, a social and medical history on the child and any medical treatment records and birth family information available. Your family is given at least two weeks to carefully consider the child’s information and to have your physician and other medical specialists review the information before deciding whether to accept the referral of the child. CHILD ASSIGNMENT: This happens after your family accepts a referral of a specific child. Assignment paperwork is sent to the foreign country and the authorities there take the steps necessary for the adoption process to proceed forward. PARENTING EDUCATION: Parenting an adopted child can have unique joys and challenges. We require all adoptive parents to complete a series of education requirements, including several online adoption courses and recommended parenting books prior to receiving their child. Your family will receive the Parent Education Requirements checklist with the Home Study Application. CHILD ARRIVAL: This will depend on whether your family has selected to adopt from a country that allows children to be escorted to the U.S. or whether your family must travel to receive your child. We will notify you when your child is ready to come home and will provide preparation and guidance about travel. POST-PLACEMENT SUPERVISION. This is provided by your family’s home study provider. The first visit must be done within four weeks of your child’s arrival home. Your social worker will assess your family and child’s adjustments to each other and provide support to help with the transition. An additional two to ten visits will be made with your family over a six-month to five-year period, depending on the country. After a minimum of six months, your social worker can recommend the finalization (or re-finalization) of your child’s adoption in the U.S.  In addition, some countries require families to provide periodic update reports for several years after the adoption, sometimes until the child is 18 years old. ADOPTION FINALIZATION: Depending on the country, the adoption may be finalized in the child’s birth country or in the U.S.  Either way, it is important to have the adoption finalized, re-finalized, or recognized in a U.S. court.  We recommend that your family retains an attorney with intercountry adoption experience to assist you with this process and with obtaining a U.S. birth certificate for your child. U.S. CITIZENSHIP: This is the final step in the adoption process. If your child enters the U.S. on an IR4 or IH4 visa, you will submit Form N600 to USCIS to receive a Certificate of U.S. Citizenship for your child after the adoption is finalized in the U.S.  If your child enters the U.S. on a IR3 or IH3 visa, your family will automatically receive your child’s Certificate of U.S. Citizenship usually within 45 days of arriving home.  We require all families to obtain a Certificate of U.S. Citizenship for their child because the certificate is a non-expiring, irrefutable record of your child’s U.S. citizenship."

;Chosen Child Adoption Services;;501 Pine Tree Road, Suite G-2;Longview;TX;75604;(214) 383-3551;;;;;;http://www.chosenchildtx.org/;The mission of Chosen Child Adoption Services is to place children in Christ-centered homes. We believe that God uses adoption as part of His plans to build families and to provide hope and ministry to birth parents, adoptive parents, and adopted children. Chosen Child Adoption Services exists to minister in love while spreading the Gospel of Jesus Christ to a hurting world. We recognize that the opportunity to reach the world begins with the willingness to meet the world at the point of its deepest need. The ministries of Chosen Child Adoption Services are directed toward providing Christ-centered solutions to the problems that confront our society daily, specifically the crisis of unplanned pregnancy. Perhaps nowhere is the need for a Christ-centered solution greater than in the area of adoption services. This is a ministry that will reach the world for Christ for generations to come, operating as an evangelical, Christian, non-profit agency providing a non-discriminatory pricing structure to adoptive parents. Our goal is to keep the cost of adoption an affordable reality for Christian families. Chosen Child Adoption Services heavily subsidizes the various ministries of the agency through individual donations and volunteer support. Chosen Child Adoption Services is committed to following the biblical principles of stewardship and financial management and seeks to publicize, promote, and present the adoption alternative to as many people as possible. The adoption process can provide a time of redirection, healing, forgiveness, and resolution to all parties involved if it is carried out with these goals in mind. Our goal, as a full-service professional agency, is to minister to each member of the adoption triad, while providing everything he or she will need to promote a positive and healthy emotional, physical, and spiritual future. A lack of accessible information regarding the adoption process has been an obstacle for far too long. By utilizing the avenues of relationship building, advertising, networking, and prayer, our hope is that all women facing an unplanned pregnancy will at the very least take time to consider adoption as a viable alternative, rather than to dismiss it completely.;Adoption Services;

Adoption Process For Adoptive Parents: Application: You have already begun the application process by downloading an information packet from A Guardian Angel Adoptions, LLC. In order to become an approved adoptive family with A Guardian Angel Adoptions, LLC, you will need to complete all of the paperwork in your packet. If you already have a current home study, please send us all of the completed documents along with your home study and supporting documents, as well as 4 profiles to be presented to the birth mothers. Our social work department will then review your information and send you an approval letter if everything is found in order. At this point you will be ready to be presented to birth mothers upon your approval. The Home Study Process: The home study is to help prepare you for your adoption and to ensure that you meet the requirements of A Guardian Angel Adoptions, LLC as well as the requirements of the State of Utah. The home study includes information given to your social worker during your home study visits, written information given by you to the social worker, and letters of reference by friends and family, as well as your medical providers. The information included in your home study offers a look at the relationships within your family, your parenting styles, and your financial status, as well as your overall physical and emotional health. We accept completed adoptive home studies from other sources that adhere to similar professional adoption standards as A Guardian Angel Adoptions, LLC, provided the individual or agency completing the home study agrees to release it to us. In addition, if we complete an adoptive home study for you, we are happy to forward it on to other newborn and domestic infant adoption agencies with which you may be working. It is necessary for your home study to be updated annually. Presentation: After you have been approved as an adoptive family by our licensed social work department, you will be eligible to be presented to birth mothers upon your approval. A representative from the adoptive family department will contact you and share with you the non-identifying information about each particular case. Included in the information will be the legal risk involved, the medical and psychological background, if possible the race and sex of the child, any reported history of drug and alcohol abuse, and the financial obligation associated with the case. You will then have the option of being presented on the case or waiting for another. Match: Once the birth mother selects you, a conference call will take place if all parties are in agreement. A member of the adoptive family department will be on the line to guide you through this process. If all goes well on the call, you will be considered matched. At this point you will be contacted by the financial department, sent a financial contract to review and sign, and will then be required to wire transfer the birth mother expenses. You will then begin to receive weekly updates on your birth mother and establish a relationship with her if both parties agree. Delivery: When your birth mother goes into labor, she will contact her case manager. The case manager will then contact the adoptive family department, who will in turn contact you. At this point you should start considering travel plans but not purchase a ticket or leave. After monitoring the birth mother for about an hour at the hospital, the medical staff will make a decision as to whether she will be admitted to the hospital for delivery or will be sent home. You will then be notified of the outcome and assisted in making plans to arrive at the hospital if necessary. If you are flying in, a representative from the adoptive family department will meet you at the airport, assist you in getting your rental car, and take you to the hospital. While the birth mother is in the hospital you will be assisted in interacting with her, the medical staff, and the baby. Placement: If your birth mother delivers in Utah, placement may occur at 24 hours after delivery provided that she is free of any narcotic drug. The social work staff will work closely with the nursing staff to ensure the birth mother is ready to sign. Signing of the documents will take place separately. The adoptive family may sign the placement documents after the relinquishment documents are signed by the birth mother. Either two witnesses or a notary will be present at the signing. Copies of the documents will be given to the nursing staff to be included in the charts of both the baby and birth mother. When the pediatrician deems the baby ready to leave the hospital, the baby will be released directly to the adoptive family. Please note that it is agency policy that the baby never leaves the hospital prior to the birth mother. Interstate Compact (ICPC): If you are a family from out of state, it will be necessary for ICPC to be cleared by Utah as well as your home state before you will be permitted to leave the state with your baby. ICPC will be started as soon as the medical records are received from the hospital. This usually takes approximately 24 hours. The medical records will complete the ICPC package and it will be hand-delivered to the ICPC office in Salt Lake City. You will be notified when this is done. If upon receiving your packet your home state office or the Utah office requests any additional documents, they will be sent them as soon as possible. You will then be notified when your ICPC clearance is faxed to our office and will be allowed to return home. Please note that ICPC is a government agency that we have no control over; however, we will do our part to process your request in a timely manner. A Word About Legal Risk: Every adoption has legal risks! They are unavoidable. Some of these risks are obvious, while others are hidden. It is the responsibility of A Guardian Angel Adoptions, LLC to watch for signs of these risks and share them with the adoptive family. Although we are experienced in adoption and will submit to you the risks we see for your evaluation, we can never guarantee the outcome of an adoption. Following are general descriptions of situations that have varying degrees of risk. These are guidelines only; a situation with minimal risk could result in losing a child, and on the other hand, a high-risk situation may finalize without a problem. Minimal Risk: There are very minimal risks when; The birth mother and birth father sign in a state where relinquishment is irrevocable, or The birth mother is not married, or she is married to the birth father and he is willing to relinquish his rights as well. Mild Risk: There is a mild risk in the following situations: An unmarried birth mother signs in a state where the relinquishment is irrevocable and although the birth father doesn’t relinquish at the time the birth mother does, either The conception was in a state with a Putative Birth Father Registry, or The birth father is not named, or The birth father is fully aware and supportive of the adoption plan. Mod Risk: There is a moderate risk if an unmarried birth mother Signs in a state where relinquishment is revocable for a short period of time, or  The birth father is known and cannot be contacted, or The birth father is aware of the pregnancy and is not supportive, or The birth mother is married to someone other than the birth father. Any time the birth mother is married, it is important to determine if the birth mother’s husband would like to parent the child. High Risk: There is a high risk if the birth mother Signs in a state where relinquishment is revocable for an extended period of time, or The birth mother is married and the husband wants the child whether he is the father or birth father and has been financially and emotionally supportive of the pregnancy and does not want the child placed for adoption. FYI…Birth father: Unless the birth father gives consent for the adoption at the same time the birth mother does, the adoption is considered a “Legal Risk Adoption.” Consequently, it will become necessary to determine then terminate his rights in accordance with the laws of any states involved with the adoption. It is ultimately the responsibility of the adoptive family to consult with an attorney of their choice about the laws of their state and the risk associated with their adoption. Going Home: Supervisory Visits: There is a supervisory period of generally six months before finalization is allowed. You will visit with a representative on two or three occasions to help ensure you and your child are adjusting to each other and to confirm the success of the placement. Additional visits may be scheduled as needed. Insurance: Notify your health insurance company of your new addition. Many companies will reimburse some expenses. Also check with your employer regarding additional benefits, and be sure to take advantage of all tax breaks. Finalization of the Adoption: This is an exciting time and can take place after a successful supervisory period, generally of 6 months. You are responsible for any legal fees associated with finalization. Talk to your worker about getting an amended birth certificate, which will list you as parents and include your child’s name as shown on the adoption decree."

We believe that every child has the right to grow up in a loving family whose unconditional love will help him to reach his full potential. We are committed to providing our adoptive families with comprehensive counseling, preparation, and support throughout the adoption process and beyond. Since our staff has extensive personal and professional experience with adoption, we know the joy that adoption brings to a family. We try to ensure that building families through domestic and international adoption is a positive experience for the child and adoptive family.;"International Adoption; Domestic Adoption; Home Study Services";International Adoption Process: 1. Submit application to Cradle of Hope. Your Cradle of Hope support team will schedule an orientation meeting. 2. Begin a homestudy, which is a series of meetings with a social worker in your state to learn about issues related to international adoption, to determine your suitability to parent an adopted child, and to help you prepare for the experience. Cradle of Hope provides homestudy services to Maryland and Virginia families. 3. Submit I-600A or I-800A application to your local JCIS office. Processing of your application can take several months, so you should begin this step even if you have not decided on a country from which to adopt, or if your homestudy is not complete. Cradle of Hope will provide a sample completed form for you. 4. Collect the documents (dossier) required by the country from which you are adopting, such as your birth certificates, marriage certificate, employment letters, references, and medical clearances. Many of these documents will also be required for completion of your homestudy, and must be notarized, authenticated, translated, and approved by the embassy of the country from which you plan to adopt. Cradle of Hope will provide you with step-by-step guidance about dossier preparation. 5. Consider a child referral. Consult medical experts. Accept referral. 6. Prepare for travel and your stay abroad with assistance from your Cradle support team. While waiting to travel, collect donations to take to the orphanage for the children who will remain behind. 7. Travel to your child’s country to meet him/her and finalize the adoption. Most families’ trips will be a few days to several weeks, depending on the country. In some programs, two or three trips are required, but only one parent must travel on some trips. Bilingual coordinators guide you through the process overseas. Your Cradle of Hope support team will be in regular phone contact with you throughout your trip, and with your family back home. 8. Obtain an immigrant visa for your child from U.S. Embassy. Return home with your child!! 9. Participate in post-placement supervision with your homestudy agency, which includes several visits over a time frame specified by your child’s birth country (usually 1 to 3 years) to make sure that the placement is going well, and to offer support and assistance in the event that outside services are needed. Reports of these post-placement visits and photos of your child are forwarded to adoption officials in your child’s birth country so that they can know the child is loved and doing well. 10. Readopt your child in your state court, in order to obtain a U.S. birth certificate and adoption decree. If only one parent travels abroad or the child was escorted to the U.S., re-adoption is required. Domestic Adoption Process: 1. You will submit you completed application with a recent photo and a $500 application fee. 2. You will meet with a CHAC social worker for an orientation meeting in our Maryland office or by telephone for out of town families. 3. You will receive provisional acceptance into the program conditioned upon CHAC approval of your completed homestudy. 4. You will sign and return our Adoption Services Agreement. 5. You will begin the homestudy process, if not already done. 6. You will prepare your Family Profile for inclusion in our Waiting Parent Notebook. 7. Upon approval of your homestudy, we will notify you of your final acceptance into our program. 8. Your Family Profile will be posted in our Waiting Parent Notebook. 9. You are matched with a birthmother. 10. The baby is born!  Placement is made! 11. The birthmother’s revocation period expires. 12. Post-placement supervision begins. 13. Family begins finalization process through the local court.
