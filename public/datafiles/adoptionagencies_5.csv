Applewood Centers has been dedicated to the care of children since 1886 and we take pride in providing the tools and support to help our foster parents become successful caregivers for children and teens during their time of need. Homes are needed to care for children of all ages, sibling groups and those with behavioral/mental health needs. Becoming a foster parent is not a job, it is community outreach. Unfortunately, children arrive into our care as a result of many issues including, but not limited, neglect, abuse (physical, emotional, sexual) or an unsafe environment. Regardless of the circumstances surrounding why they have come into care, these are still children in need of a community's care. These children are in need of people, such as yourself, to ""show you care"" by becoming a foster parent.";"Foster Care and Adoption";

Unfortunately, it’s not a perfect world, child abuse and neglect is real and over 400,000 children are placed in the foster care system each year. The Bair Foundation Child & Family Ministries exists to provide quality care & services in a family setting for children and adolescents who cannot remain with their families. The primary mission of our Foster Care program is to ensure the safety and well-being of foster youth while working with their families of origin in their reunification efforts. We accomplish this with support (Intensive In-Home & Family Services) and/or parental training (B.E.S.T. for Families). When reunification is not possible, our goal is to find an alternative permanent and stable living solution which may include Kinship Care, Adoption, or Independent Living. If adoption is a viable option, The Bair Foundation actively seeks adoptive parents to move toward permanency. Since 1967, The Bair Foundation Child and Family Ministries has brought hope, restoration and family preservation through a partnership of committed individuals, churches, corporations and government agencies. You can help us change the future for this vulnerable population of young people. We are doing all we can, but we can't do it alone.

Historically, Catholic Charities has responded with love and compassion to those who have looked to the Church for help and hope in their time of crisis. Catholic Charities Regional Agency maintains an adoption license and facilitates adoption services and placements on behalf of the four Catholic Charities social service agencies in the Diocese of Youngstown. Thousands of children in the State of Ohio are in the foster care system, waiting for permanent adoption placements. Many of these children are school-aged and/or possess special needs. Catholic Charities believes that finding homes for Ohio’s waiting children should be a priority. A number of children in foster care “age out” of the system each year, meaning that they are released as independent adults at the age of 18. These young adults, many of whom are still in high school, are at-risk for poverty and/or other serious challenges including homelessness, incarceration, and addiction. Catholic Charities believes that offering services to these children preparing for independence without family support should be a priority. With regard to its adoption services, Catholic Charities can provide information to couples interested in adoption, and help pregnant women create an adoption plan if the need is presented. Catholic Charities can also work with parishes to recruit adoptive families for Ohio’s waiting children. In order to protect the rights and the emotional well-being of all parties involved in the adoption process, Catholic Charities will remain faithful to its history of not facilitating open adoptions.

Required by the State of Ohio, the classes are designed to educate you about the children available for adoption, and to prepare you to parent them. We offer the classes throughout the year at various times and locations- Click here to view the schedules. 3. Submit Your Adoption Application. During the first session of training you will receive an application packet. Fill in the application form as completely and accurately as possible and return it to Northeast Ohio Adoption Services. If you have questions we are available to assist you- ask your pre-service trainer or call our office. 4. Home Study (a.k.a Family Assessment). Once your application has been received, a NOAS social worker will be assigned to begin your Home Study. The process, which usually takes 4 to 6 months to complete, is designed to help us gain an understanding of you, your family, and your environment. Throughout the study we will be working with you to determine what type of child (or children) will be the best match for you. 5. Matching Process - Finding Your Child(ren). Once your home study has been approved, you are ready for the next step. Keeping in mind the preferences you expressed during your home study, and working closely with you, your NOAS worker will begin the search to find a child(ren) for your family. Children are what this is all about! From the first contact with NOAS, families can learn about children who are waiting for adoptive families. If parents are interested in a child on referral to NOAS there will be ample opportunity to talk with the NOAS worker who knows that child(ren) best. We feel this is an essential ingredient in the recipe for success. Placements are not made based on how long a family has been waiting, but rather through a matching process. Through a team effort involving both parents and social workers, a match is made by considering the child’s needs and the family’s ability to meet those needs. 6. Visiting. This stage begins after you and your NOAS worker have identified a child for your family, AND after the child’s custodial county has selected you as the adoptive parent(s). A typical placement begins with a meeting at a restaurant or park, followed by an afternoon visit to your home, then builds to weekend visits, and overnight visits, until eventually the child moves into your home. 7. Placement. Both before and after a child is placed with an adoptive family, NOAS staff are there to assist the family. Staff are sensitive and knowledgeable about the process and the feelings all family members experience. They are available to offer help, support and encouragement. Once a placement has occurred, a social worker will continue to visit the home at least once a month. 8. Legalization. When the family is ready to take the final step to make the new family arrangement permanent, (generally 6-12 months after placement) NOAS staff will be there to help. They work with the courts to complete the necessary paperwork and accompany the family on this most important day. 9. Post-adoption services. After an adoption is legalized, our agency’s required involvement comes to an end, however NOAS staff remain available to families whenever there is a need–whether it is 3 months or 3 years after legalization. A home visitor can assist families in locating needed services, linking them with respite or just connect adoptive families with one another for support. Since many of the children placed are school-age or older, and know their identifying information, NOAS supports the concept of openness in regards to adoption. Many children have important connections, with foster parents or family members from their past, which need to be maintained."

Rush";;;;"mrush@ofycares.org";"http://www.ofycares.org/";"Options for Families and Youth (OFY) is a private, non-profit, 501(C)(3), social service agency licensed by the Ohio Department of Job and Family Services since 1989. OFY initially began as a provider of specialized and emergency foster care services for the Cuyahoga County Department of Children and Family Services (CCDCFS) in 1990. Since that time OFY has served the needs of this population of children/adolescents who have been neglected; physically, sexually and emotionally abused; and deemed dependent by the Juvenile Court system. OFY has addressed the needs of over 3,000 children and adolescents who needed a temporary place to call home while attempts were made to reunify them with their biological families. Today OFY continues to provide specialized and emergency foster care services to between 50-60 children and adolescents in 50-60 licensed foster homes all located in Cuyahoga County. In 1997, OFY began to provide adoption services to foster parents for the Cuyahoga County system and for our own foster parents whose foster children became eligible for adoption. Over the years, we have finalized the adoptions of over 300 children with special needs. We have continued this to the present day through our contract with Cuyahoga County. In addition, OFY has completed home studies and post-placement reports for private domestic and international adoptions. We recently became a Private Child Placing Agency that offers Domestic Infant Adoption services to birthparents and prospective adoptive families.  OFY also received Hague Accreditation from the Council on Accreditation (COA) in November 2013 and is a provider of International Adoption Services. From 1995 until June of 2013, OFY provided service coordination and home visitation in Cuyahoga County through contracts with Invest In Children and Help Me Grow. OFY has been an industry leader in the area of early intervention services in Cuyahoga County serving over 17,000 children since our initial contracts. We continue to have a great reputation of offering parent education, child assessment, support and linkages to community services to needy children and their families in Cuyahoga County. OFY has a Behavioral Health Services unit that has been growing steadily since 2007 when we first received our national accreditation from the Commission on Accreditation of Rehabilitation Facilities (CARF). Our clinical team now consists of a licensed psychologist and five licensed therapists that exclusively serve the Medicaid population of Cuyahoga County. While OFY is not as large as some organizations or hasn’t been around as long as others, our commitment to offering quality services to the children and families of Cuyahoga County is as strong as ever.

Adoptive parents may qualify for financial assistance to help them support their adoptive children. All the children available for adoption are currently in some form of foster care setting. This means the parental rights of the child's parents have been terminated, making the child legally free for adoption. Foster parenting may, under some special circumstances, be an avenue to adoption. Foster parenting can sometimes make it possible for a child to enter your home sooner than if you wait until a particular child becomes available for adoption. In fact, adoptions by former foster parents make up a large percentage of our adoptions.";"Adoption";"A social worker will be assigned to work with you during the adoption process. The social worker will meet individually or with a group of other prospective adoptive parents to talk with you about adoption and provide information covering such things as child discipline, guidance, etc. Time will be spent talking about you and your family, and you will also have an opportunity to talk about the type of child you think would best fit into your family. While being prepared for adoption, you will be involved in a home study process. After the home study is complete, you and the worker will be ready to determine which child would best fit your family. After the adoption committee meets and recommends you for the child, pre-placement visits will begin. When the planned visits are completed and both you and the child are ready to proceed, arrangements are made for the actual move of the child into your home. Generally the adoption can be finalized about six months to one year after a child is placed with you. The Social Worker will be talking with you and visiting regularly during this period. Then you will go to court, where a judge will declare the child to be a permanent member of your family."

Just like foster parents, adoptive parents need to work hard to incorporate the child into their family so that they may be successful not only in the placement, but in life. Once the child's adoption is finalized, the adoptive parents take on full responsibility for that child's health, education, and overall well being. To become an adoptive parents you must meet certain requirements and also be willing to participate in a very thorough and in-depth home study process. The requirements include such things as being at least 18 years old, having an income that is sufficient to support your household, and being free from any condition that could negatively affect the care of a child in the agency's permanent custody. Some of the activities that must be completed during the home study process are as follows: home visits by an adoption assessor; interviews with all household members; fire and safety inspections; fingerprinting/criminal record checks; medical examinations; reference checks. Furthermore, all adoptive homes must attend a 36 hour pre-service training prior to approval by the agency. Once all activities are completed successfully, the agency will approve your home study. Unlike foster parents, adoptive parents are not licensed by the state. After approval, the adoptive parent’s home study can be considered for the placement of children in any agency's permanent custody. Updates of the home study must occur at least once every two years. Other services that may be available to adoptive parents include the following: adoption assistance/subsidies, pre-finalization services, post finalization services, medical card and case management. It is important to note that eligibility for some of the financial programs must be determined (on either the child and/or the family) and therefore, may not be available for every adoptive family.";"Home Study; Adoption Assistance/Subsidies; Pre-Finalization Services; Post Finalization Services; Medical Card; Case Management ";

Other times, adoptive families are needed to provide children with permanent homes.  In Ohio, public and private agencies have thousands of children waiting for adoption. The children range in age from toddlers to teenagers.

Adams County Children Services is the agency responsible, by law, for helping children who are at risk of being abused, neglected or dependent. Whenever possible, our goal is to keep the children in their homes. However, when necessary, the children may need to be placed in an alternative setting until they can be reunified safely with their family. ";"Foster Care; Adoption";"Foster/Adoptive Process: The Homestudy Process - After an inquiry is made and an application is submitted to our office, a Homestudy Assessor will be assigned to help guide you through the process. The homestudy is an exploration of the applicant’s history, characteristics and strengths that will lead to successful foster/adoptive placement. In addition, many documents must be completed and available for review by your assessor. These documents include but are not limited to: Physical exams and Medical statements, Financial statements, Verification of marital status, Verification of employment, Criminal background checks, Safety audit of the home. The homestudy process can take up to six months to complete, however, many families complete the process more quickly. Prospective foster/ adoptive parents must complete 36 hours of ""Pre-Service"" training in order to complete the requirements to become a licensed foster parent/approved adoptive parent. This training is designed to enhance your understanding of foster/adoptive parenting issues and to increase knowledge about the needs of children whose lives have been impacted by abuse and neglect. The upcoming class schedules are located under the ""Foster/ adoption Training"" tab. Foster/ adoptive parents must also become certified in Adult/ Child/Infant CPR & First Aid within the first two years of certification; however, we welcome anyone who is already certified in these areas with proof of certification. Matching Children and Families - Adams County Children Services will evaluate the characteristics of children you are approved for in your homestudy when considering placement matches for your family. The length of time it takes to be matched with a child largely depends on the characteristics of children that you are willing/ able to parent. A family who demonstrates the ability to parent a child with many needs may not wait long for a child to be placed with them. When a child has been identified for your family, you will be contacted and available information will be shared with you regarding the child. The placement coordinator will give you time to consider the information and will assist you in making your decision about placement. Once a family agrees to a placement, pre-placement visits (if possible) are arranged to assist an easier transition into the home. Foster Care Placement - Foster parents are considered part of a professional team, along with the staff of Adams County children Services. Our goal is to work together for the benefit of the children we serve. Children are removed from their homes when they are abused, neglected or dependent and their parents are unable to care for them safely. If a relative is not available or identified, children are placed on a temporary basis with foster families in the least restrictive placement possible; preferably in their own community. A family's ability to provide stability, nurturance and love that children need is paramount for successful foster parenting. You must also be able to prepare your family for the grief and loss that may come along with children leaving your home when they reunify with their birth family. Foster parents are asked, when safe and appropriate, to work with biological families and assist with reunification. When reunification is not possible or in the best interest of the children, the agency secures an adoptive home and oftentimes the foster family becomes the adoptive family. Once a child is placed with your family, the child's caseworker will make at least monthly visits to your home. The caseworker also assists in coordinating services such as counseling, physical/speech/occupational therapy, etc. In addition, respite care is available and the Foster/Adoption Specialist can help arrange this support if needed. Adoptive Placement - Prior to a child being placed with an approved adoptive family, detailed information about the child's background will be supplied in writing. Such background information will include all known non-identifying information regarding the child's:  Birth parents and other relatives; Medical, emotional, and psychological history; Past and current known developmental issues; School history, if applicable; Placement history. The Foster/Adoption Specialist will allow you time to consider the information and will assist you in making your decision about placement. Pre-placement visits (if possible) are arranged to assist an easier transition into the home. Post-adoption services are also available. At the time of an adoptive placement, these services will be discussed in detail with you."

Every effort is made to work with the family to keep the child at home. However in some cases, the child must be separated from his or her family until the family can stabilize. Foster care provides children with a temporary home until the child can be safely reunited with his or her family. When a court decides children cannot safely return home, an adoptive home offers them a permanent, stable, loving family. When children are placed in foster care or adoption, care givers are responsible for meeting the children's basic needs. Foster placements and most adoptive placements are eligible for financial support from the agency to assure the needs of these children are met. Foster homes are temporary places to stay, while adoptive homes are forever. However, both must be loving and safe environments where children can learn to give and receive love, and develop to their full potential. Many foster children and adopted children have grown to be successful citizens, parents, employees and community leaders. They have reached success because their foster and adoptive parents believed in their potential and did not give up, even when things got tough. We need parents who have faith in themselves and in children, who believe they can make a difference in a child's life, who are willing to take a chance and who are willing to learn. Parenting is a tough job. It can take a while to see the rewards, but there is nothing more satisfying than seeing those rewards. There is no other endeavor with such long lasting effects.";"Foster Care and Adoption";

In those cases, the court may terminate the biological parents’ rights, and grant “permanent custody” to children services. In these cases, all legal ties to the biological family are severed. The agency’s goal transitions from reunification to identifying a “forever” family - an adoptive home - for the child. There are over 3,000 children in Ohio who are awaiting forever families through public children services agencies. Children waiting to be adopted are all ages, genders and cultures. Some children are brothers and sisters who want to be together in a forever home. The majority of these children have been removed from their homes because of abuse, neglect or abandonment. These children dream of belonging to a family and having someone to call mom or dad. These children are in need of people like you to give them a forever family where they will feel loved, cared for and kept safe for the rest of their lives. Adoption is a lifelong promise of care and love and should be supported and welcomed by all members of the adoptive family. In addition to parenting skills such as patience, perseverance, resourcefulness, and tolerance, families who step forward to adopt should be able to put the needs of the children first. Families that work with Children Services receive free “pre-service” training. “Pre-service” training sessions are meant to help the family prepare for the unique needs of children who have been abused or neglected, and provide good parenting information. Completing the home study process is designed to be a mutual assessment process where the agency and foster caregivers work together to determine if foster care and/or adoption is the best option for the prospective foster caregivers.

Foster parenting may, under some special circumstances, be an avenue for adoption.

The adopted child becomes a legal family member and takes on the last name of his/her adopted parents. The adopted parents become legally, morally and financially responsible for all aspects of the child’s care. Children become available for adoption only after reunification with their biological family is not possible or not in their best interest. If a relative is not available or identified to adopt or permanently care for the children, then an adoptive placement is pursued. Children in the permanent custody of Summit County Children Services are often adopted by their foster parents. All adoptive parents will also be licensed for foster care. The goal is that children will only have one placement if reunification does not occur.

When a relative/kinship placement is not available, TCJFS makes every effort to place children in a substitute care placement that best meets the needs of the children, but yet is in the same community/school district. Speedier reunification of the children with their birth family can occur when children are placed in close geographic proximity to the birth family. TCJFS also recognizes the importance of the sibling bond. Therefore, TCJFS makes every effort to place siblings with the same caregiver, unless there is a compelling reason to separate the siblings.  If siblings must be separated, continuous effort is made to reunite the siblings.  When siblings are placed separately, arrangements for frequent visitation between siblings are a routine part of case planning. Reunification with the birth family is the goal for children who come into care. Most of our children in foster care are successfully reunited with their primary family or extended family members known as kinship placements. Therefore, we need foster parents who can: understand the importance of birth families in the lives of all children, who will support a reunification plan, and have the capacity to deal with the reality of saying good-bye to children leaving foster care (for whom they have grown to love). Removal from birth families is a difficult journey for our children.

During the intake appointment, you let us know the type of family you are looking for, if you have or need a doctor, what financial assistance you need, you medical background, and you can ask as many questions as you want. The birth father is welcome to attend this appointment if you would like. He can be as involved as you and he would like. Step 2: After the intake, we will begin looking for an adoptive family. Your Birth Parent Counselor will set up a time to meet with you so that you can view each family’s profile. If you do not like any of these families, please let your Birth Parent Counselor know, and we will present you with additional profiles. Once you are successfully matched with a family, your Birth Parent Counselor will assist you in speaking with the family on a conference call and then meeting with the family face-to-face.

Once your expenses are approved by a judge, your Birth Parent Counselor will pay your bills and provide you with gift cards for any other needs (clothes, sundries, transportation, etc.). Your Birth Parent Counselor will be present during the birth and is there to advocate for you. During this time, you can spend time with the baby and see the adoptive family. After you discharge from the hospital, your Birth Parent Counselor will take you to court where you will relinquish your parental rights. After court, your rights will be terminated. You can still see the baby and the adoptive family. Your Birth Parent Counselor will continue to support you and help you.

We will help you determine which intercountry programs you qualify for, since each of the foreign countries has varying requirements. PRE-ADOPTION WORKSHOP: This is a required online course that prepares your family for what to expect throughout the adoption process, with particular focus on country-specific family requirements  and procedures. This course must be completed prior to receiving the Home Study Application. HOME STUDY APPLICATION: This is a collection of documents and information about your family that is required based on state, U.S. and foreign government regulations. The application helps us get to know you better, assists the social worker’s preparation of the home study, and helps your family “rehearse” for dossier preparation. Criminal background and child abuse checks are initiated at this time. The Home Study Application cannot be processed until all requested documents and copies are received. U.S. CITIZEN & IMMIGRATION SERVICES: USCIS determines each family’s eligibility and suitability to adopt a child from a foreign country. The process begins with your family filing the I-600A application (non-Hague adoption) or the I-800A application (Hague adoption) with USCIS. We will provide your family with instructions for filing either form after Application Part 2 is approved. USCIS will inform your family of the location and date to have fingerprints taken for a FBI criminal background check. If approved, USCIS will send your family an approval notice. The I-600A is valid for 18 months; the I-800A is valid for 15 months. Your family must renew either form filed as many times as necessary to ensure the USCIS approval is valid at the time the child’s U.S. visa is issued. INTERNATIONAL ADOPTION SEMINAR: This provides your family an in-depth learning opportunity to explore issues relevant for intercountry adoption and adoptive families and helps your family build realistic expectations for both the adoption experience and the child joining your family.  Topics include: attachment, grief and loss, medical issues, impact of institutionalization and environment on child development, talking to your child about adoption, racial and cultural identity, initial adjustments and more. Your family must complete the seminar prior to completing your home study. Completion of the seminar helps fulfill the USCIS and Hague Treaty requirement for pre-adoption counseling and education. This is an online class available on www.dillonadopt.com. HOME STUDY: This is an evaluation of your family, which is requested after the Home Study Application has been approved. A social worker usually has two to four visits with your family, including a home visit to get to know you, your parenting styles, your resources, and your reasons for adopting. The intent of the home study is to assess your family’s readiness and suitability to adopt a child. The Home Study also helps educate and prepare your family for the adoption experience and the child joining your family. The social worker will submit a current home study in compliance with the require ments set up by your state of residence, U.S. government and the foreign country.  Our Agency will provide the social worker with guidelines for preparing your home study and will review your home study to ensure it complies with requirements. DOSSIER: Once your family’s home study is completed, your family will prepare a dossier for submission to the foreign country you have chosen (with the exception of Korea). The dossier is a set of legal documents, which includes your family’s home study and provides information, which helps foreign government officials in determining if your family meets the country’s requirements for adopting a child. We review your family’s dossier documents to ensure they meet country requirements. Depending on the country, our staff may also process the documents and obtain authentication or apostille certificates. CHILD REFERRAL: Our Agency receives information on a child from the foreign country. The child’s information is then presented to your family by your home study social worker or an agency representative. Referral information will include one or more photos of the child, a social and medical history on the child and any medical treatment records and birth family information available. Your family is given at least two weeks to carefully consider the child’s information and to have your physician and other medical specialists review the information before deciding whether to accept the referral of the child. CHILD ASSIGNMENT: This happens after your family accepts a referral of a specific child. Assignment paperwork is sent to the foreign country and the authorities there take the steps necessary for the adoption process to proceed forward. PARENTING EDUCATION: Parenting an adopted child can have unique joys and challenges. We require all adoptive parents to complete a series of education requirements, including several online adoption courses and recommended parenting books prior to receiving their child. Your family will receive the Parent Education Requirements checklist with the Home Study Application. CHILD ARRIVAL: This will depend on whether your family has selected to adopt from a country that allows children to be escorted to the U.S. or whether your family must travel to receive your child. We will notify you when your child is ready to come home and will provide preparation and guidance about travel. POST-PLACEMENT SUPERVISION. This is provided by your family’s home study provider. The first visit must be done within four weeks of your child’s arrival home. Your social worker will assess your family and child’s adjustments to each other and provide support to help with the transition. An additional two to ten visits will be made with your family over a six-month to five-year period, depending on the country. After a minimum of six months, your social worker can recommend the finalization (or re-finalization) of your child’s adoption in the U.S.  In addition, some countries require families to provide periodic update reports for several years after the adoption, sometimes until the child is 18 years old. ADOPTION FINALIZATION: Depending on the country, the adoption may be finalized in the child’s birth country or in the U.S.  Either way, it is important to have the adoption finalized, re-finalized, or recognized in a U.S. court.  We recommend that your family retains an attorney with intercountry adoption experience to assist you with this process and with obtaining a U.S. birth certificate for your child. U.S. CITIZENSHIP: This is the final step in the adoption process. If your child enters the U.S. on an IR4 or IH4 visa, you will submit Form N600 to USCIS to receive a Certificate of U.S. Citizenship for your child after the adoption is finalized in the U.S.  If your child enters the U.S. on a IR3 or IH3 visa, your family will automatically receive your child’s Certificate of U.S. Citizenship usually within 45 days of arriving home.  We require all families to obtain a Certificate of U.S. Citizenship for their child because the certificate is a non-expiring, irrefutable record of your child’s U.S. citizenship."

First of all, because we are committed to creating families and our priority is meeting the needs of orphaned children and the needs of your family. There are many other good reasons you may consider our agency: the Executive Director of Adoption Avenues and the International Program Director, are of Eastern European descent; we were born in Romania and lived and worked there for 35 years. We are both Physicians and we have volunteered many hours working in orphanages in Romania. We had a care center in our home for orphan babies that had been abandoned in the hospital after birth. We have a full understanding of all medical diagnoses and all other issues that orphan children face in the countries that our agency works in. After we came to the US we tried to keep up with the high American education standard so we continued to study: the Executive Director has a Master of Science in Clinical Psychology, and the International Program Director took the American Medical Licensing Examination. Adoptive parents have to know that the Eastern European medical terminology is different form the American Medical Terminology; same with the psychological evaluation of the child. You need somebody to help you with these difficult issues. This is where our expertise comes in. We are well equipped professionally to deal with the medical and psychological issues of these children in an integrated manner. Our social workers are also highly specialized in international adoption; they have a Master degree in social studies and is well acquainted with International Adoptions. We know more about international adoptions than other adoption agencies that have only heard of these countries from their office computer here in America. It is often the case that other Directors have never lived or traveled in any of the Eastern European, African or South American countries but we did. Therefore, we can give our adoptive parents a wealth of information about all the countries we work in and help them understand that those countries are not like America and they need to adjust to those country's rules and regulations. Because of our heritage and experience it is our pleasure help our adoptive parents and give them guidance on how they need to adjust to that country for the time they will spend there in order to assure a smooth and successful adoption. We have worked and will continue working for these children to find loving families for them with all our hearts and not just for a fee. We travel several times a year to all Eastern European, African and South American countries that we work with and we have in depth knowledge of their customs, life style, orphanages, economic and political issues and adoption processes. The facilitators we work with in these countries are well educated, well trained and ethical professionals. They are knowledgeable about international adoption, reliable and dependable. We have many years of experience of working in international adoption and with orphan children. We have the expertise, the cultural familiarity, the training and a wealth of knowledge that sets us apart from any other adoption agency. We are able to provide you with excellent services.

During the home study process, you will complete training to develop a better understanding of the needs of the children living in foster care. The training will also provide information on resources available to you. Once the home study is complete, you will begin the waiting process. A family’s home study will be valid for two years. 2. Waiting Process: Once the home study is approved, your family can receive updates on children available for adoption. You may then make a request to your case manager to be considered as an adoptive family for children available for adoption. Multiple home studies may be reviewed by caseworkers at any given time. There is no guarantee that a state caseworker will select your family for committee/review or that your family will be selected as the adoptive family for a child during this time. 3. Adoption Committee/Review Process: Families may be selected for a child by an adoption committee or through a review by the child’s state caseworker. 4. Placement Process: Once your family is chosen by the adoption committee/review, placement of the child in your home will happen in approximately two to eight weeks. Placement timelines will depend on the child’s age and needs. Meetings with your family and child will be arranged and facilitated by the DHS in order to begin a bonding process before the child’s official placement in your home. 5. Post-Placement Process: Upon placement of the child in your home, monthly post-placement visits are required for a minimum of 6 months and/or until the adoption is finalized."

The first step in beginning the process of adopting a child is to complete an inquiry form which can be accessed on our website through the on-line link located on the home page, or by contacting us. This ""pre-application"" gets the process started by letting us know a little about you. Once you submit the inquiry form we strongly encourage you to enroll in Adoption Education Courses. These valuable classes will orient you to the unique challenges associated with adoption. 2. Once CFA receives your inquiry form we will send you our application. We ask for some general information about the adoptive parents. Along with the application we will need to send in a criminal history release forms and fingerprints. This form will be sent to you after you have spoken with a caseworker and have received your application forms. To speed the process we ask that you sign and return the criminal records check form which permits us to obtain the required criminal history check from the state of your residence. Depending on the caseload at the state office, the criminal history check may take a longer than expected period of time to obtain. This is why we suggest starting this process as early as possible. 3. After the program director reviews your application a home study packet will be sent to you. The packet will contain detailed forms requiring information pertaining to each family member, family finances, medical history, and reference forms. 4. Another component of the home study packet requires you to write an autobiography. While we're not looking for a Pulitzer Prize winning volume, we do ask that you frequently refer to the list of questions that will help you address the information we are seeking. We suggest that you not write the entire autobiography in one sitting. Take time to have fun with it. Some of the questions are introspective, and you may learn something interesting about yourself or your past through this valuable component of the process. The adoption process may be a lot of work, but it's worth it. Our caseworkers are available to help you with the process in any way they can. If you have any questions please contact CFA. Over the years our caseworkers have helped families complete the lengthy paperwork trail, and they are more than willing to provide assistance for you too. 5. Once the home study packet is submitted, your caseworker will contact you to schedule the first of four potential meetings at your home. During the home study visit your caseworker will personally evaluate your home environment. Don't worry, we won't be checking behind the refrigerator for dust-bunnies. We are merely attempting to get a feel for the type of environment in which the child will be placed. Each family member will be interviewed in order to obtain an accurate understanding of the family dynamics. 6. After the interview process is finished your adoption caseworker will draft your home study. Then they will invite you to read it for corrections. The caseworker will then complete the home study and it will be ready for submission. 7. Though the adoption may complete, CFA likes to stay in touch with our families regarding counseling issues that may need to be addressed. We also love to hear your stories and have you share pictures with us. Please feel free to contact us at any time during and after the adoption process. Remember our goal is to make every CFA adoption a success."
