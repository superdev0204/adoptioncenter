After reviewing the materials, the family returns the completed Adoption Application, Response Form, and a check or money order for the non-refundable application fee of $150.00.  (Additional forms must also be completed after contact with CFS has been made.) Step 2: Adoptive Home Study - An adoptive home study is also called a family assessment or pre-placement investigation. The home study is conducted by a social worker who has special training in adoption. These social workers are credentialed by the state as knowledgeable in adoption matters, and are called Certified Investigators in Adoption Matters. In South Carolina, they can work for an agency or in private practice. Adoptive families working with CFS may have their home study conducted by a CFS certified investigator, by another agency’s certified investigator, or by a certified investigator in private practice. The home study involves preparation, or training to become adoptive parents. It also involves assessment of the prospective adoptive family to be sure that they can be recommended for adoption. The certified investigator will have to review several documents such as birth certificates and medical reports. The investigator will also ask the family to complete several forms, which give information about everything from your childhood to your finances. Criminal records will have to be checked as part of the study. The adoptive home study will require at least one visit in your home. Step 3: Portfolio - The portfolio is a scrapbook or photo album that the adoptive family puts together to tell a little bit about themselves, without identifying who they are. The expectant mother looks through portfolios to select a family for her baby. It does not have to be big or fancy, but it should be an honest picture of you and your lifestyle. The portfolio is needed by the time the adoptive home study is finished. Step 4: Office Visit - When the adoptive home study is approved, the adoptive family is invited to CFS for a visit to meet the staff, and to prepare for the day a child will be placed with them for adoption. Step 5: Placement - When the expectant mother selects an approved adoptive family, the social worker contacts the family about her and the baby she is expecting.  Information such as her health and lifestyle, the legal situation, openness desired, and costs involved is shared with the family to help them decide if this is the baby for them.  On the date of placement the adoptive family comes to the hospital or CFS office to take the baby into their care. Step 6: Finalization - After placement, the family’s attorney has 60 days to file the adoption papers in the court. The family has to wait 90 days from the date the papers are filed before an adoption hearing can be held. During this 90 day supervisory period, a certified investigator visits in the home to be sure that the baby is healthy and happy, and writes a post-placement investigation report. After the finalization, an amended birth certificate is awarded. When the birth certificate is awarded, you can file for a Social Security card for your child."

Heaven Sent Children Adoption, a Middle Tennessee adoption agency, is comprised of four experienced adoption professionals, all of whom are also parents through adoption.  Our staff believes deeply in supplying our clients with best practice social work to prepare them for the needs of their adopted child and family after their child’s placement.  This begins with a cooperative, trusting relationship between worker and client during the home study process.  It is our goal to know our clients well, so that we can best advocate for them, assist them through the process and be there for them in times of need even after an adoption is complete.  Adoption is a lifelong process.  Who you choose to work with is important.";"Domestic Adoption: Private adoption through Heaven Sent Children, Interstate adoptions, Independent adoptions, Foster adoptions/public agency adoptions, Embryo adoption; Intercountry Adoption";"THE PROCESS FOR DOMESTIC ADOPTION: 1. Send us your completed application with your $200 application fee. 2. Complete the home study with Heaven Sent Children. The home study is a 10-12 page written report that tells about you and your family. The document includes sections on each member of the family, marriage, medical, employment, financial, description of the home, arrest record (if any), religion, attitudes towards children, discipline, and counseling for adoption. Typically, 4 visits are required and each visit is about 2-3 hours in duration. Your Adoption Counselor may recommend that you attend classes, support groups, and read articles/books on adoption to better prepare you for the journey of adoption. 3. Prepare a birth parent profile booklet with the assistance of your Adoption Counselor. 4. Once a prospective family is approved, the wait for a match with a birth mother/birth parents begins. Length of time for matching varies and is dependent on the decisions of the birth parents and the requirements for the family regarding race, gender, alcohol/drug use during pregnancy, and openness in adoption. 5. Families may choose to work with a larger placing agency to increase their opportunities for domestic placement.  Your Adoption Counselor can share information on out-of-state adoption agencies that will accept your home study and assist with an interstate adoption. 6. There may be contact with the birth parent prior to placement.  The child is typically placed with the family from the hospital.  For interstate adoptions there is the additional step of processing the child and birth mother’s documents for adoption.  The paperwork must be reviewed and approved by the sending state and the State of Tennessee. 7. Arrangements will be made by the agency for placement of the child in the adoptive home immediately after the birth of the child. 8. If a family is completing an interstate adoption, they must stay in the child’s birth State for up to two weeks while the paperwork is being processed for the adoptive placement.  The child will be in the care of the adoptive parents during that time. 9. Post adoptive supervision begins within 2-4 weeks of placement of the child with the adoptive family.  These visits will be conducted in the family’s home and arranged at a time that is convenient for the family and Adoption Counselor. A minimum of 3 visits occur over a six month time frame. However, if a child originates from another State the laws of that State may require more visits. 10. Finalization of the adoption will occur once post placement supervision and termination of parents has been completed. THE PROCESS FOR INTERNATIONAL ADOPTION: 1. Send us your completed application with your $200 application fee. 2. Complete a home study. The home study is a 10-12 page written report that tells about you and your family. The document includes sections on each member of the family, marriage, medical, employment, financial, description of the home, arrest record (if any), religion, attitudes towards children, discipline, and counseling for adoption. Typically, 4 visits are required and each visit is about 2-3 hours in duration. Your Adoption Counselor may recommend that you attend workshops, support groups, and read articles/books on adoption to better prepare you for the journey of adoption. 3. Decide on a Country & Placing Agency. YourAdoption Counselor can assist you in choosing the program which best meets your criteria. Heaven Sent Children partners with placing agencies with programs in your country of choice (see Professional Association link). Families typically make this decision while in the Home Study process. 4. File with United States Citizen and Immigration Services (USCIS). YourAdoption Counselor will assist you with completing the appropriate forms and applying after your home study is complete. 5. Begin Education. Hague requirements are that each adoptive parent complete 10 hours of adoption preparation education, unless your placing agency requires more. YourAdoption Counselor can give you information on completing this education requirement.  All education must ve completed during the home study process. 6. Prepare the legal documents (dossier). The documents required by each country vary, but will include documents such as birth certificates, marriage certificate, physicians letters, reference letters, police clearance letters, and CIS approval. We can work with you in completing your dossier and having it certified and legalized. These documents will be filed in court or presented to government officials in the country your child resides in. They will be used to process your adoption. 7. Receive and accept a child referred to you. In consultation with yourAdoption Counselor, you will receive a referral of a child, from your placing agency, which usually includes a picture, background information and a medical report. It is always advised that families seek a medical opinion to help them make an informed decision when accepting a referral. 8. Travel. You will be notified when you need to travel to the country and enter your petition to adopt in court, bring your child home after finalization, or when you child is being escorted to you. As soon as the legal work is complete, you are the child's legal parent, and you complete your immigration visa with the U.S. Embassy in that country and return to the United States. 9. If your child is being escorted to you, the legal work and visa are completed first and then permission is granted for the escort to leave the country with your child. Home. After your child is home, we will begin the post placement visits with your family. These must be completed according to the laws and policies of Heaven Sent Children, your child's country, and your state. The purpose of these reports is two fold. To show the country of origin that the placement of the child in your care was a good decision and to assist you with the adjustment of parenting a child from another country. 10. Citizenship and Re-adoption. Upon arrival home, begin the process to obtain your child's social security number, certificate of citizenship and complete the re-adoption in Tennessee to receive a Tennessee Report of Foreign Birth Certificate. YourAdoption Counselor can assist you in completing these steps."

Our first call was from a young woman who wasn't even sure how she found the number. She simply said, ""I think I'm pregnant. Can you help me?"". That first phone call ignited our passion at Life Choices. We exist to help those women who are asking the same question our first client asked so long ago. ""Can you help me?"" Our priority at Life Choices is to truthfully answer women's questions with the respect and dignity we feel all women deserve - regardless of their ultimate decision. In 1987, Life Choices became a state-licensed child-placing agency and has seen more than 225 women complete adoption plans for their infants. We hold positions of leadership in the West Tennessee Council of Adoption Agencies and the Adoption Center of the Mid-South. One of our adoption clients recently wrote, ""Yes, sometimes when I think about my daughter, I'm sad. But then I think of how happy she is and how faithful the family is in sending pictures and letters, and I know I made the right decision for both of us.""  In 2007, Life Choices converted into a medical clinic, including diagnostic pregnancy testing and limited obstetrical ultrasound under the supervision of a licensed medical doctor and on-site registered nursing staff.For women who choose to make a life-affirming decision in their pregnancy, we offer counseling to help her make a positive plan for both she and her baby.  If she chooses to end the pregnancy and they experience issues that they feel are related to that decision, we offer post abortion counseling by our trained staff of counselors. Life Choices is committed to provide a non-judgmental and Christ-like environment designed to educate and empower women to make life-affirming decisions.  The vision of Life Choices is to strategically change the procurement of abortion by providing intervention, education, and support services for women and families in crisis and by raising awareness in the community as to the obstacles we face and the opportunities available in addressing pro-life issues. Life Choices believes adoption to be a godly and biblically-rooted concept. We believe that adoption is a life-affirming option for a woman experiencing an unintended pregnancy, as well as a desirable way for a couple to build their family. Because we realize that adoption is not the right decision for all of our clients, we do not encourage adoption over parenting. Instead, we trust that God will reveal his best plan to the biological parents to whom the child has been entrusted. Life Choices believes that birth families choosing adoption are to be commended for their maturity and sacrificial love. In order to provide the compassionate care and support to all members of the child’s birth family, Life Choices has trained counselors available for the entire family unit who may also experience the loss upon releasing a child for adoption. Life Choices believes that adopting a child should be financially accessible and that potential adoptive families should be treated with respect and compassion. At Life Choices, families will find that our professional staff is available to help lower the frustration levels that are often associated with the adoption process. We will strive to educate families about adoption and keep them as informed as possible throughout the process. Life Choices believes adoption to be a permanent, covenant relationship between both the adoptive family and the child, as well as the adoptive family and the birth family. Along with Life Choices, the birth family and adoptive family work together, always keeping the child's best interests in the forefront when making the arrangements for the placement and afterwards. Life Choices is committed to foster an atmosphere of mutual cooperation, respect, and love throughout the adoption process.";"Adoption Services; Medical Services; Counseling Services";

Issues such as experience and exposure to children, the applicants’ parenting received when they were children, values and discipline will be explored. 4.

We will discuss how to educate the child on his or her adoptive status, how to educate others, proper words and timing, books on adoption, trans-racial adoptions, contact with birth parents, background information on any prospective adopted child, completing a profile and many other issues common to adoption.

We love our city, the culture, and we believe that child abuse is not a government problem, it’s not a particular race, or socio economic issue but rather a community issue, that can only be tackled by coming together. We have recently re-located to the Catholic Life building off 4-10 and Harry Wurzbach and we would love for you to drop by and learn more about the San Antonio AWFC team!

The Tyler office is a fast growing office with new foster families joining our mission! Our staff are dedicated to supporting the families and children they serve, going above and beyond the call of duty to help parents and children be successful.

We specialize in helping teens in the foster care system have hope and a future with our L.A.U.N.C.H!

They present that “down home” feeling of knowing that in a smaller community, people take care of one another. This community may be smaller, but when someone is in need, the staff or the foster families will be the first to go and help. Victoria being one of the smaller communities amazingly always has an extensive amount of support when children need to be sponsored for Christmas. Although they don’t have the volume of people that a larger city has, they certainly have the heart. Our Victoria staff has extensive knowledge in working with children and families and has great connections with all of the available services that can benefit children and families.

But while foster care provides a wonderful transitional environment, our long-term desire is to help provide each of these children with a family they can call their own - for the rest of their lives. Which is why, back in September of 2008, we expanded our service options to include not only foster care, but adoptions. It began in the most logical place, with those foster care families who desired to make the children under their care a permanent part of their families. Then we added matched adoptions, helping place children in the homes of non-foster families. Should you decide to adopt and choose ACH, you’ll find yourself part of our family. You’ll find our adoption care team to be helpful, knowledgeable, and extremely good at what they do.

Orientation: During the orientation, general information will be provided about the adoption process. In addition, the future adoptive families will be informed about the philosophy and vision of Children and Family Institute, as well as the policies and procedures involved in the adopting process. If the adoptive parents wish to proceed further with this agency, they will receive a packet of informational materials to review. 2. Training: The adoptive training is designed to help prospective parents assess their readiness to adopt and learn new parenting skills. Parents wishing to adopt TDFPS (State Children) will have to attend 20 hours of training individually and/or in a group setting. Parents adopting infants from CFI will attend 8 hours of training in a group or individual setting. Additional training maybe required to meet your child’s individual needs. 3.  Home Study: During this process a family profile will be developed. Each adoptive parent will participate in a series of interviews, together and individually, designed to meet and exceed state licensing requirements. Discussions with a adoption caseworker will cover: a parent’s motivation to adopt, the type of child(ren) they wish to adopt, health status, marital and family relationships, views regarding parenting, childhood experiences and relationships, financial situations, sensitivity to children experiencing separation and loss, sensitivity toward birth parents, sensitivity to different socioeconomic, cultural, and ethnic groups, etc. 4. Selection Process: A search begins for the child being requested by the adopting family. During this process, the adopting parents will decide if a child is right for their family. Before beginning the selection process, each adoptive family has decided to have their home study considered for and submitted to Texas Department of Family and Protective Services (TDFPS), or matched with a birth mother for infancy adoptive placement. With infancy adoptive placements, there are three types of adoptions the family can decide to accept (open, semi-open, and closed adoption) based on each of their comfort levels (see adoption types). 5. Presentation: During a presentation, information regarding the adoptive child’s and birth parent’s background is presented to the adopting family (e.g., medical, psychological, and social history, and school records). 6. Pre-placement: If the family decides to parent the child(ren), pre-placement visits will be arranged and scheduled. The types and length of pre-placement visits will vary depending on each child’s age, needs, and location of each family member in the placement. 7. Supervisory Placement: This is a six month supervisory period in which the child lives in the home of their permanent family. Monthly contacts are made by the adoption caseworker to help all family members with their adjustment and attachment needs and provide any assistance needed with counseling, support, guidance, and referrals for all family members in the adoption process. 8. Consummation: During the finalization of the adoption process, the adopting families will need to select an attorney and file a petition to adopt. The adoption caseworker can assist the family in obtaining an attorney knowledgeable in state and infancy adoption law. Once the judge signs an adoption decree, the adopting family is able to receive a new birth certificate and social security number. Congratulations! 9. Post-Adoption Services: Free post adoption services for an adoption placement from Texas Department of Family and Protective Services will be offered through Lutheran Social Services. Post adoption services for domestic infant placements with CFI may be offered with a nominal fee. Children and Family Institute provides on-going services to families who have made an adoption plan with this agency, children adopted through this agency, the adoptive families adopting from the state. These services may include facilitating on-going contact with the birth parents, providing updated information regarding social and medical history of a birth parent, or providing counsel to parents as they are confronted with adoption issues while parenting their child.

A foster family receives a child into their home for a temporary placement with the plan for the child to be reunified with their birth family. 2. If the birth family is not able to successfully complete their birth plan within the 12-18 months granted by the court, and appropriate relatives are not identified to take custody of the child, the parental rights most likely be terminated. 3. Once the parental rights have been terminated and a 90 day appeal period has passed, the child is considered to be legally free for adoption. 4. A foster family that is also verified for adoption usually receives the first option to adopt a child that becomes legally free for adoption and is placed in their home. 5. The Covenant Kids Case Manager will work with the family to complete required documentation and ensure that the child has been in the home for at least six months. 6. The adoption is legally finalized!; The Matched Adoption Process: 1. Covenant Kids submits the final homestudy for a family approved by the agency to be considered for children that are legally free for adoption.  The family can search the Texas Adoption Resource Exchange (TARE) at www.adoptchildren.org and contact Covenant Kids about children they are interested in. Also, Covenant Kids advocates on behalf of the family with CPS to locate children who match the family’s criteria. In both cases, Covenant Kids communicates with CPS regarding the family’s interest in the child and submits the family’s home study and life book to the CPS worker. 2. CPS staff and advocates for the child review the homestudies for all families interested in adopting the child to select a panel of families that appear to be the best candidates. 3. If your family is considered to be a good match for the child, CPS and Covenant Kids will work togehter to evaluate the unique needs of the particular child and your family’s ability to meet the child’s needs. 4. The selected family will then recieve detailed information about the child and will be asked to carefully consider their decision before moving forward. 5. If the family chooses to proceed, visits between the family and the child would begin.  This is a time for everyone to become acquainted before the child moves into the home. 6.  Placement paperwork is signed to mark the child’s move from their foster home into your adoptive home. 7. For the next six months, the child is put in adoptive placement in the family’s home. The Covenant Kids Case Manager visits the family and child to help with the adjustment. 8. The adoption is legally finalized!"
