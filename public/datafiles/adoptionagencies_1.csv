My goal has always been to be a small, licensed Alabama agency that provides personal guidance and counseling through every step of the way! My focus has never been to grow and branch into other states. Working with Alabama women who choose an adoption plan will always be the number one focus of A Angel Adoptions. ""I have always been very proud of the quality adoptive families adopting through our agency. It is very important to me that adoptive families receive counseling services during and after the adoption, as well as education, training and handholding throughout the process. Although a few birth mothers request a closed adoption, the majority of birth mothers are requesting varying levels of openness in their adoption plan.""";"Adoption Services";

AGAPE is a Greek word meaning “love,” a love that fulfills its purpose by reaching out and helping others. While we may be a state-licensed agency, we are also a family … a family that reaches out to help others in need.";"Adoption: Domestic Adoption, International Adoption, Closed Adoption [Confidential Adoption], Open Adoption [Cooperative Adoption]; Foster Care; Crisis Pregnancy";"The first step in any adoption process is to obtain a home study, which is a report that approves a family to adopt. This process can take several months to complete, depending on the type of adoption. Once the social worker has completed the home study, the report is sent to a placement agency of the adoptive family’s choosing for the placement of a child. The placement agency then matches an adoptive family with a child. The wait time and placement fee will vary depending on the placement agency. Once a child has been placed in an adoptive home, a social worker monitors the placement to ensure that both the family and the child are adjusting and transitioning well during the post-placement period. At the finalization, the child becomes the permanent and legally adopted child of the adoptive parents. The following gives you a general outline of the adoption process. Contact the Social Services secretary at AGAPE of North Alabama at 256-859-4481 for informational packets and forms. Return the completed forms to our offices with your application fee of $200. You will be contacted by our staff to plan your home study when your forms have been reviewed and approved by AGAPE and the State of Alabama. All states require home studies for adoptive families. A home study consists of family interviews in the home and in AGAPE’s offices as well as: verification of marriage; criminal background checks; verification of financial stability; personal references; training on adoption and other issues. Birth parents may choose to meet prospective adoptive parents in open domestic adoptions. Eventually, a court finalizes each adoption. The adoptive family selects their own attorney to help finalize the legal process on their behalf.  In addition to the $200, there are other fees charged by AGAPE. Based upon the individual circumstances/demands of each adoption, information about those fees will be shared with you during the adoption process."

We place children with both married couples and single approved applicants. At CFS we see adoption as a lifelong commitment to a child. It is not a way to get through a tough patch in your marriage, or a means of coping with infertility. It should be a thoughtful decision and, for couples choosing adoption, it should be a mutual decision. CFS is committed to you to insure a smooth transition for your entry into parenthood. Because of the high quality of professional care we offer the birth mother, we believe we in turn offer you a safer, more secure adoption.";"Adoption; Counseling Services; Project Rachel; Hope and Healing Support Group; Birth Mother Services";"The process of adoption is wonderful and trying, exciting and frustrating. It is begun by contacting the agency nearest you to be put on our Inquiry List. As soon as we can begin a home study, an adoption worker will contact you and schedule the first joint interview. This may be immediately or it may be several months depending on the number of approved families to whom we have already committed. There will then be a series of interviews, joint and individual, as well as in office and in your home. With each new interview you will be given paperwork to complete and return to your worker. Once the study has been completed and approved by our joint staffs, you will be notified and will then be considered for any available and appropriate infant based on your preferences and the infants available. Although the time varies to complete a home study, it normally takes three to four months. It is a major commitment by the applicants and the agency social worker. General Requirements for Adoptive Applicants - Residency: The adoptive family requesting to adopt through CFS must be residents of the Diocese of Birmingham in Alabama;  Marriage: Couples who have been married at least (3) years and singles applicants are accepted for consideration of a home study; Religion: The applicants must be of a Christian faith, either Catholic or Protestant. We will also need a reference from your priest or minister attesting that you are a member of a church and that you will raise the child in a Christian home.  Childlessness: Priority for healthy, white infant placements is given to childless couples who, for medical reasons, have been unable to have children. If the wife becomes pregnant during or after the approval procedure but before placement, the application will be placed on hold and closed once the child is born. In the case of miscarriage, the application will be returned to its former position and continued according to usual procedure, Adoptive applicants who already have a child or children living in their home may only be considered for placement of a hard-to-place infant. In cases where one spouse has a child from a previous marriage, but that child does not live in the home with the prospective adoptive applicants, an application to adopt a healthy white infant can be given. However, if both spouses have children from previous marriages, an application to adopt a healthy white infant can not be taken, even if none of the children live in the home of the prospective adoptive couple; Health:  During the home study process, reports of medical examinations are required on the applicant(s) and on other members of the household, if any, to indicate that they are in good health. If two (2) years elapse between the time of the original examination and placement, a medical update is required. If health problems arise, additional medical reports may be required; Financial Stability: There is no minimum income level for applicants. The family should have sufficient income and savings to meet its needs and provide for the child or children without difficulty. An adequate income as well as good money management is considered important; Duplicate Application: You may be on several waiting lists awaiting a home study. However, an application will not be accepted if the applicant has an active application on file with another agency. Applications are usually not accepted if the applicant has been rejected by another agency, but consideration may be given on an individual basis; Childcare Plan: Adoptive applicants are required to submit a childcare plan during the home study process. In order to facilitate adjustment and bonding, the agency strongly encourages one parent to remain in the home with the child for at least sixty (60) days or longer after placement; Fees: The agency adoption fee is 10% of the adoptive parent(s) annual gross income. The minimum fee is $2,000 and maximum is $10,000. This minimum fee can be waived or adjusted for special circumstances (e.g. special needs child, hard to place child or financial considerations). An hourly fee of $80.00 is assessed for all adoption services leading up to placement. This fee is deducted from the total fee you have agreed to pay. Separate fees are: Alabama Bureau of Investigation and FBI background check of $49 per person; Medical exams; Attorney fees incurred by applicants to finalize the adoption.

The greatest effort spent on each couple will be the home study. A home study is a series of interviews in which the social worker concentrates on collecting information via face-to-face contact with each couple. The home study typically consists of an orientation interview followed by 4 home study interviews. 1. The first interview is a home visit in which the social worker will address each of the qualifications for adoption. This is a joint interview. 2. The next visits are individual interviews and are typically held at the LCS office. Both spouses may come on the same day, if they must travel to get to the office. If they are local, each spouse may schedule his or her own interview at his convenience. The interviews will be autobiographical in nature and will be based on an Autobiography written by the applicant. The social worker will ask that you complete this Autobiography prior to this interview. 3. The third interview will focus on parenting philosophies and plans. Issues such as experience and exposure to children, the applicants’ parenting received when they were children, values and discipline will be explored. 4. The fourth interview will focus on adoption education. We will discuss how to educate the child on his or her adoptive status, how to educate others, proper words and timing, books on adoption, trans-racial adoptions, contact with birth parents, background information on any prospective adopted child, completing a profile and many other issues common to adoption. Education is a very important part of the home study process. Each family in the domestic program is required to attend Lifeline’s domestic adoption conference in Birmingham, Alabama. This conference is a two day interactive training which will prepare and equip families for the joys and challenges of domestic adoption. After the home study process is completed, families will begin the matching process. Each family will create a family profile. Family profile’s are shown based on the birth mother’s preferences. Lifeline requires that at a minimum adoptive couples be willing to meet the birth mother before the adoption takes place, and to send correspondence through Lifeline to the birth family after the placement."

For example, once to meet the child and formalize acceptance of their referral, then a second trip to be present at court, and then a third trip to bring their child home.  Some countries require only one trip; others may require two or three.  Some countries will permit children to travel home escorted rather than having the parents travel for another trip, but most do not allow this. 7.

Each participating country in the agency’s adoption program has invited Dillon International to help find homes for their vulnerable children. Since our beginning, Dillon International has placed over 6,000 children from developing countries with loving, adoptive families in the United States. Several hundred additional children have been placed with families in their country of birth as a result of Dillon’s efforts. In addition, Dillon International has helped to underwrite hospitals, orphanages and schools in Korea, India, China, and most recently in Vietnam.";"Adoption";"APPLICATION: This allows our agency to get acquainted with your family and determine if your  family meets the requirements for our agency and the U.S. government. We will help you determine which intercountry programs you qualify for, since each of the foreign countries has varying requirements. PRE-ADOPTION WORKSHOP: This is a required online course that prepares your family for what to expect throughout the adoption process, with particular focus on country-specific family requirements  and procedures. This course must be completed prior to receiving the Home Study Application. HOME STUDY APPLICATION: This is a collection of documents and information about your family that is required based on state, U.S. and foreign government regulations. The application helps us get to know you better, assists the social worker’s preparation of the home study, and helps your family “rehearse” for dossier preparation. Criminal background and child abuse checks are initiated at this time. The Home Study Application cannot be processed until all requested documents and copies are received. U.S. CITIZEN & IMMIGRATION SERVICES: USCIS determines each family’s eligibility and suitability to adopt a child from a foreign country. The process begins with your family filing the I-600A application (non-Hague adoption) or the I-800A application (Hague adoption) with USCIS. We will provide your family with instructions for filing either form after Application Part 2 is approved. USCIS will inform your family of the location and date to have fingerprints taken for a FBI criminal background check. If approved, USCIS will send your family an approval notice. The I-600A is valid for 18 months; the I-800A is valid for 15 months. Your family must renew either form filed as many times as necessary to ensure the USCIS approval is valid at the time the child’s U.S. visa is issued. INTERNATIONAL ADOPTION SEMINAR: This provides your family an in-depth learning opportunity to explore issues relevant for intercountry adoption and adoptive families and helps your family build realistic expectations for both the adoption experience and the child joining your family.  Topics include: attachment, grief and loss, medical issues, impact of institutionalization and environment on child development, talking to your child about adoption, racial and cultural identity, initial adjustments and more. Your family must complete the seminar prior to completing your home study. Completion of the seminar helps fulfill the USCIS and Hague Treaty requirement for pre-adoption counseling and education. This is an online class available on www.dillonadopt.com. HOME STUDY: This is an evaluation of your family, which is requested after the Home Study Application has been approved. A social worker usually has two to four visits with your family, including a home visit to get to know you, your parenting styles, your resources, and your reasons for adopting. The intent of the home study is to assess your family’s readiness and suitability to adopt a child. The Home Study also helps educate and prepare your family for the adoption experience and the child joining your family. The social worker will submit a current home study in compliance with the require ments set up by your state of residence, U.S. government and the foreign country.  Our Agency will provide the social worker with guidelines for preparing your home study and will review your home study to ensure it complies with requirements. DOSSIER: Once your family’s home study is completed, your family will prepare a dossier for submission to the foreign country you have chosen (with the exception of Korea). The dossier is a set of legal documents, which includes your family’s home study and provides information, which helps foreign government officials in determining if your family meets the country’s requirements for adopting a child. We review your family’s dossier documents to ensure they meet country requirements. Depending on the country, our staff may also process the documents and obtain authentication or apostille certificates. CHILD REFERRAL: Our Agency receives information on a child from the foreign country. The child’s information is then presented to your family by your home study social worker or an agency representative. Referral information will include one or more photos of the child, a social and medical history on the child and any medical treatment records and birth family information available. Your family is given at least two weeks to carefully consider the child’s information and to have your physician and other medical specialists review the information before deciding whether to accept the referral of the child. CHILD ASSIGNMENT: This happens after your family accepts a referral of a specific child. Assignment paperwork is sent to the foreign country and the authorities there take the steps necessary for the adoption process to proceed forward. PARENTING EDUCATION: Parenting an adopted child can have unique joys and challenges. We require all adoptive parents to complete a series of education requirements, including several online adoption courses and recommended parenting books prior to receiving their child. Your family will receive the Parent Education Requirements checklist with the Home Study Application. CHILD ARRIVAL: This will depend on whether your family has selected to adopt from a country that allows children to be escorted to the U.S. or whether your family must travel to receive your child. We will notify you when your child is ready to come home and will provide preparation and guidance about travel. POST-PLACEMENT SUPERVISION. This is provided by your family’s home study provider. The first visit must be done within four weeks of your child’s arrival home. Your social worker will assess your family and child’s adjustments to each other and provide support to help with the transition. An additional two to ten visits will be made with your family over a six-month to five-year period, depending on the country. After a minimum of six months, your social worker can recommend the finalization (or re-finalization) of your child’s adoption in the U.S.  In addition, some countries require families to provide periodic update reports for several years after the adoption, sometimes until the child is 18 years old. ADOPTION FINALIZATION: Depending on the country, the adoption may be finalized in the child’s birth country or in the U.S.  Either way, it is important to have the adoption finalized, re-finalized, or recognized in a U.S. court.  We recommend that your family retains an attorney with intercountry adoption experience to assist you with this process and with obtaining a U.S. birth certificate for your child. U.S. CITIZENSHIP: This is the final step in the adoption process. If your child enters the U.S. on an IR4 or IH4 visa, you will submit Form N600 to USCIS to receive a Certificate of U.S. Citizenship for your child after the adoption is finalized in the U.S.  If your child enters the U.S. on a IR3 or IH3 visa, your family will automatically receive your child’s Certificate of U.S. Citizenship usually within 45 days of arriving home.  We require all families to obtain a Certificate of U.S. Citizenship for their child because the certificate is a non-expiring, irrefutable record of your child’s U.S. citizenship."

Families Are Special has become recognized for domestic and international placements as well as placements out of foster care. FASI has been at the forefront in recruiting adoptive families and sponsoring networking activities for adoptive families. Our experience has shown that most adoptive families want to know as much as possible about adoption. We hope you do too, because we have found that the more adoptive families know about adoption, the more comfortable they and their adoptive child(ren) will be.

These children need permanent families to ensure a healthy upbringing and positive adulthood. A Better Way recruits, trains, and supports families who are open to sharing their lives, particularly with older (age 6+) children, and becoming a permanent connection with them through adoption. We support individuals and families that wish to adopt by working to match them with a child, guiding them through the bureaucratic and legal requirements, and helping to prepare them emotionally as they transition from the foster care system to a loving adoptive family. After the adoption is finalized, A Better Way continues its services to help integrate and stabilize the new family and keep this connection with the family until the child reaches age 21. Our skilled staff members guide families through the adoption process for children who are in foster care. The process includes pre-adoption services (initial orientation, comprehensive training, home study, paperwork support) and post-adoption services (behavioral health services, referrals and parenting groups).

AASK America provides education and support services to adoptive and foster families and children. We also promote positive changes to benefit children who are in the child welfare system. AASK inspires change in the lives of children in foster care by promoting and sustaining permanent families. We identify and train competent, caring foster care and adoptive parents, provide education and support services, and nurture stable homes for foster kids. AASK has promoted permanency for foster youth and placed thousands of children with loving families since 1973.";"Adoption; Foster Care; Family Support";"This is an overview of steps you will take to a bringing a child into your home. Whichever path you choose, AASK will be there to support you every step of the way! All services provided by AASK described here are free of charge. 1. Informational Workshop: The beginning of your journey with AASK is to attend one of our Informational Workshops held each month, generally the 2nd Tuesday of the month from 7-9pm at our office in Oakland. You can also attend a live Webinar. In the session we’ll provide an overview of the child welfare system and the foster care and adoptive processes, and answer any initial questions you may have. This is a comfortable atmosphere with other families who are looking into adoption or foster care for the first time. Following the Informational Workshop, families complete a Family Profile Form in order to schedule a Personal Interview. Additional informational workshops can be arranged for your church, community group or workplace. 2. Personal Interview: This is a chance to meet individually with an AASK Social Worker to tell us more about your family, your strengths and background, and your hopes and expectations for working with AASK. In the interview, we will address any concerns you may have, make sure that AASK is the best agency for you to be working with, and confirm that your family goals are in alignment with the children that are presently available for foster care or adoption. 3. Foster and Adoption Application and Family Training (FAFT): The application process includes fingerprint, criminal record and child abuse clearances and some paperwork necessary to begin the foster and/or adoption process. AASK has a specially designated staff person (our Program Assistant) who is skilled at guiding families, offering support, and answering questions throughout the entire application process. State regulations require that families complete their application within 120 days or receiving an application from AASK, or may have to start over. While in the Application process, you will participate in a fast moving and participatory two-day weekend training with other families, to learn more about the foster care system; issues related to birth families mental health; grief, trauma and loss; attachment; cross-cultural parenting; and positive parenting strategies. You will also meet one or more AASK parents and children who will tell their own stories and answer your questions. FAFT Trainings are held quarterly. 4. Foster and/or Adoptive Homestudy: After completing all required application materials, families are assigned to an AASK Social Worker who will follow your family through the entire foster/adoption process. Your Social Worker will interview your family at home in a series of personal interviews (individual, couple, and family) in order to write your homestudy. The homestudy is a document required by the State for all foster care placements and adoptions and generally takes 4-6 weeks to complete. It describes your family, relationships and home environment in depth, highlighting your strengths and desires. The homestudy is the primary tool used by AASK and County Social Workers to find a strong match between you and a waiting child or children. 5. Home Certification, Matching, & Placement: Once a homestudy is complete, families can begin the matching process and attend AASK’s certification training. AASK’s certification training involves an in-office training as well as a home inspection. The matching process may involve reviewing children’s profiles and meeting children in person at matching picnics. This stage may take anywhere from a few weeks to over a year, as it is important to make sure every match is a strong one. Once a possible match is determined, families proceed to initial visits with a child prior to placement. Once a child or children are placed in your home, your family will receive monthly financial assistance to meet their daily needs. Medi-Cal health insurance is provided for all foster children. At this point, the process varies based on the chosen path: A. Concurrent Planning Family. For a Concurrent Planning Family, the home inspection portion of the certification will happen once a child is identified as a potential match. When your family identifies interest in a child’s profile, your AASK Social Worker communicates with the child’s County Social Worker to address any issues and determine the best course for you and the child. A child’s placement may be short-term or long-term, depending on whether the county is looking for a permanent home or working on reunifying a child with his or her birth parents. Since most waiting children are not yet ‘legally freed’ for adoption, a child in a Concurrent Planning Family will move into your home as a foster placement. The Concurrent Planning process allows you to begin building the bonds of family while the legal process unfolds. An AASK Social Worker will visit twice a month. After at least six months of foster-adopt placement, and if reunification with the birth family fails, your family may be able to move toward adoptive placement if this is in the best interest of the child. This is a legal step proceeding a finalized adoption. B. Adopting a Medically Fragile or Special Needs Baby or Child. Once a homestudy is finished, families can begin the matching process. This includes reviewing children’s profiles, and may involve meeting children in person at matching picnics. This stage may take anywhere from a few months to over a year, to make sure every match is a strong one. When you are interested in a particular child or group of children, we communicate with the child’s County Social Worker to address any issues and determine the best course for you and the child. Once a possible match is determined, families proceed to initial visits with the child prior to adoptive placement. An AASK Social Worker visits your family at least monthly during placement and prior to a finalized adoption. C. Fostering A Child or Teen. Foster certification involves two steps: a 4-hour in-office training, detailing Title XXII regulations, and a home inspection. For Foster-Only Families, the two-step foster certification will happen immediately following the homestudy completion. As a Foster-Only family, you may want to accept immediate emergency placement of a child. Foster families can often be matched very quickly. An AASK Social Worker visits your family twice monthly and is on-call for emergencies on a 24-hour basis. 7. Reunification or Adoption Finalization: If a child’s plan is reunification with his or her birth family, your AASK Social Worker will guide you through the process and assist with the transition process for the child and your family. If a child’s plan is adoption with your family, your AASK Social Worker will walk you step-by-step through the finalization process and provide you with all the necessary legal paperwork. You will not need an attorney. The court date of finalization is a day of celebration for both AASK and your family."

Post Placement Supervision meetings with your Adopt International Social Worker. 10. Make a court date to finalize your domestic adoption. International adoption is a wonderful way to incorporate cultural awareness and help a child who needs a family. The process varies in time and expenses, depending upon the country that you select. Here are the steps: 1. Understand the rules. The process differs if you are adopting from a Hague or non-Hague country. Our staff can assist you in understanding the regulations. 2. Complete an Adoption Home Study. The Home Study agency that you choose to work with should be a place where you have confidence in their expertise and services. 3. Hire a placing agency. Your Home Study agency may be your Placement Agency, or you may choose another agency that identifies your child and helps complete your adoption in the foreign country. 4. Obtain Immigration Pre-approval Make an application to the United States Citizenship and Immigration Service (USCIS). If you are adopting from a Hague Country, you will be filing an I-800A; if you are adopting from a non-Hague Country, you will be filing an I-600A. 5. Prepare your dossier. Every country has a list of documents required when making an application; this may go to a central authority, the attorney or court. The list must be provided by the placement entity, the organization working in or with the foreign country. 6. Receive a child referral or assignment. The agency with whom you are working will identify a child that matches the request that you have made. 7. Child Acceptance. Families review the information with medical professionals so that they make an informed decision before they sign their acceptance. It is important never to accept a referral that you believe is not right for you, and we will advocate for you. The child’s needs should always be the priority. 8. Pre-placement and Placement Travel. Some countries may require visits to the country prior to placement. 9. Complete Post Placement Supervision. State law requires that you have meetings with a social worker after your child is in your home. We take this opportunity to provide support, education and guidance in making your child’s transition and attachment as healthy as possible. 10. Finalize or Readopt. We will walk you through how to file the right court documents so that you can receive your final Adoption Decree and a new birth certificate that reflects you as the parent/s. Although readoption is not required in our state, it is the easiest way for families to obtain a US birth certificate. 11. Post Adoption Support for Adoptees and Adoptive Families. ADOPT believes that adoption is a life long issue, and we will support you whenever an adoption issue arises."

We offer a variety of domestic programs and services to families considering adoption. In addition, Adoption Horizons also facilitates independent adoptions through its Infant Placement Program. Domestic, hospital placements are carefully coordinated to meet all the legal requirements as well as provide professional social services and counseling. This program requires families to be enrolled in another of Adoption Horizons programs. This is the beginning of your exciting journey through adoption!

Congratulations on taking the first important step towards becoming an adoptive family. Have faith and confidence that it can happen for you as it has for hundreds of families associated with this agency. Adoption Horizons is based in Eureka, California and is a private adoption agency. Adoption Horizons is licensed to work in the following counties in California: Butte, Colusa, Del Norte, El Dorado, Glenn, Humboldt, Lake, Lassen, Marin, Mendocino, Modoc, Napa, Nevada, Placer, Plumas, Sacramento, Shasta, Sierra, Siskiyou, Solano, Sonoma, Sutter, Tehama, Trinity, Yolo, and Yuba. ";"California’s Waiting Children Program; Infant Placement; Intercountry Program; Homestudy Process; Post Placement; Private Consultation";"Step 1: Inquiry Phase. You begin the adoption process with Adoption Horizons by making an inquiry contact by phone. During this brief interview, you will provide us with basic information that will help us share some important facts about adoption and our agency. After this contact, you will receive an information pamphlet about our agency and other adoption materials. Next, you are invited to attend our Meet-the-Agency Night, which is held on the third Wednesday of each month from 7:00 – 8:00 p.m. at our office. At this meeting, you will learn the history of Adoption Horizons, the role of the governing Board of Directors, and state licensing features. In addition, you will be given an overview of the adoption process, expenses and how the homestudy process works. Often, a Board member, social work staff member and an adoptive parent will also attend. You are then invited to a free consultation meeting with a program director to discuss specific program guidelines and review qualifying information. This appointment takes 1 to 1½ hours and requires both potential applicants (if married) to be present. At the end of the consultation—and an adoption appears feasible—you will receive an Adoption Horizons Application Packet. (Cost: $75.00). A motivated family can easily complete this part of the adoption process in one to four weeks. Step 2: Application & Approval Phase. Adoption Horizons works with about twenty new clients and five birthmothers a year and accepts clients all-year-round for all programs. Applicants may begin the adoption process as soon as their application has been reviewed and accepted and they have contracted for services. When an application has been accepted, the applicant is then invited to “Contract for Adoption Services” which takes 1 to 1½ hours. During this meeting, the family will be asked to sign various contracts, and will be given an orientation to their “Contract Binder” which contains all the materials needed from the start through the finalization of their adoption. The homestudy and program fees are due at this time. ($3,500 – $4,500). Now a family’s journey to adopt their child begins. Shortly after contracting, the family’s preliminary information will be forwarded to their assigned social worker who will make contact with them to set up their homestudy appointments and home visit. Over the next three months, the family will be asked to do the following: 1. Meet and talk by phone to other experienced adoptive families. 2. Collect and complete all documents necessary for the homestudy. 3. Make a final program selection. 4. Attend all homestudy meetings and start to prepare their program’s dossier or presentation packet. 5. Complete the foster care license application (Fost Adopt). 6. Attend adoption education classes. 7. Attend Meet-the-Agency Night & While-U-Wait Meetings. A motivated family can complete this process in 90 days.. Step 3: Waiting / Search and Referral Phase. Upon completion of your homestudy and foster care licensing (if pertinent), you are now ready to accept a child into your home. We call this the “waiting/search/referral” stage of your adoption. This period can last from two months to two years depending on your selected program. The search and referral stage is the most difficult of the entire process. All the paperwork, visits and classes have been completed, therefore you have taken care of most of the agency process until referral. This time period can be very difficult for families, as often the agency cannot give you a clear idea about when you will get a referral. This varies from program to program, but for some programs, you must exercise patience; and Adoption Horizons cannot guarantee the placement of any child. A family must understand there are many factors that are outside of our control when processing an adoption. The waiting/search/referral stage is very important because it gives you time to prepare for receiving the child. Some of the activities and preparations we recommend during this time are: Read about your child’s culture; Decorate your child’s new room; Get in shape so you can walk long distances and/or carry a heavy baby; Take parenting or infant care classes; Connect with other adoptive parents; Read about special needs cultural-related issues; Prepare family members or siblings; Attend Adoption Horizons monthly While-U-Wait group meetings; Attend adoption education classes. Once you have been offered a child, the following happens: 1. You receive a picture or video of the child and available background information. 2. You meet the birthmother during her pregnancy (Infant Placement Program). 3. Meet with the agency to discuss your referral. 4. You sign a post-placement contract and pay the fee ($1,000 – $3,500). 5. You prepare for travel or travel multiple times to meet the child. 6. You work with your social worker to prepare for the child’s homecoming. Step 4: Post Placement / Legal Adoption Phase. Once your child is placed, you will initiate the legal process to either adopt or re-adopt in California. Families often lose interest in completing the necessary paperwork as they now have a new little person who is occupying their time and space. Many families find it particularly difficult to complete the paperwork once the child arrives. We have a finalization clerk who will maintain contact with you to assure that this final leg of the adoption process gets completed in a timely manner. You will be asked to turn over key documents, as well as attend monthly Post Placement meetings. Also during this time, you will be busy doing the following: 1. Settling your child into your home. 2. Introducing your child to friends and relatives. 3. Attending and receiving monthly guidance and support from your adoption social worker. 4. Working on adjustment issues or attending counseling sessions. 5. Completing the court documents for adoption. 6. Attending a court appointment to make your adoption final"

This year, maybe we can help even more children find permanent homes. We have an innovative program called Concurrent Planning. This means that we can place children with a potential adoptive home while we continue working with the birth family to help them overcome the issues that brought them to our attention. This benefits the children as it reduces the number of placements they experience and the trauma inherent in moving multiple times. The benefit to potential adoptive families is that the children will have faced fewer traumatic moves.";"Adoption";

Foster Care offers a less restrictive level of care versus the services offered in residential or group home settings. Crittenton provides qualified foster families for children who are unable to safely remain with their biological families or that do not have family to care for them. The goal is to place all children with trained and certified foster or resource families to provide a full range of benefits and services that will address the child’s individual needs as well as offer a nurturing and protective environment. This also includes enriching foster or resource families by connecting them with community organizations such as faith based agencies, resettlement agencies, and mentors. Crittenton is committed to providing foster care placement that will offer stability, support, and care to the children who need this the most.  Therefore, when appropriate, Crittenton encourages foster or resource parents to consider adoption as a possibility and as a concurrent plan in the event that family reunification does not occur for the child. Furthermore, Crittenton also strives to prepare our youth for independent living such as with life skills training and vocational services in an effort to obtain economic self sufficiency.";"Foster Care; Adoption";

Centrally located in the United States, Dillon International is based in Tulsa, Oklahoma, and was the first licensed international adoption agency in the state. Throughout our history, Dillon International has been actively involved in establishing intercountry adoption standards and policies both in the United States and abroad. The agency has helped to establish adoption programs in several countries, including a model foster care program in Korea. Each participating country in the agency’s adoption program has invited Dillon International to help find homes for their vulnerable children. Since our beginning, Dillon International has placed over 6,000 children from developing countries with loving, adoptive families in the United States. Several hundred additional children have been placed with families in their country of birth as a result of Dillon’s efforts. In addition, Dillon International has helped to underwrite hospitals, orphanages and schools in Korea, India, China, and most recently in Vietnam.";"Adoption";"APPLICATION: This allows our agency to get acquainted with your family and determine if your  family meets the requirements for our agency and the U.S. government. We will help you determine which intercountry programs you qualify for, since each of the foreign countries has varying requirements. PRE-ADOPTION WORKSHOP: This is a required online course that prepares your family for what to expect throughout the adoption process, with particular focus on country-specific family requirements  and procedures. This course must be completed prior to receiving the Home Study Application. HOME STUDY APPLICATION: This is a collection of documents and information about your family that is required based on state, U.S. and foreign government regulations. The application helps us get to know you better, assists the social worker’s preparation of the home study, and helps your family “rehearse” for dossier preparation. Criminal background and child abuse checks are initiated at this time. The Home Study Application cannot be processed until all requested documents and copies are received. U.S. CITIZEN & IMMIGRATION SERVICES: USCIS determines each family’s eligibility and suitability to adopt a child from a foreign country. The process begins with your family filing the I-600A application (non-Hague adoption) or the I-800A application (Hague adoption) with USCIS. We will provide your family with instructions for filing either form after Application Part 2 is approved. USCIS will inform your family of the location and date to have fingerprints taken for a FBI criminal background check. If approved, USCIS will send your family an approval notice. The I-600A is valid for 18 months; the I-800A is valid for 15 months. Your family must renew either form filed as many times as necessary to ensure the USCIS approval is valid at the time the child’s U.S. visa is issued. INTERNATIONAL ADOPTION SEMINAR: This provides your family an in-depth learning opportunity to explore issues relevant for intercountry adoption and adoptive families and helps your family build realistic expectations for both the adoption experience and the child joining your family.  Topics include: attachment, grief and loss, medical issues, impact of institutionalization and environment on child development, talking to your child about adoption, racial and cultural identity, initial adjustments and more. Your family must complete the seminar prior to completing your home study. Completion of the seminar helps fulfill the USCIS and Hague Treaty requirement for pre-adoption counseling and education. This is an online class available on www.dillonadopt.com. HOME STUDY: This is an evaluation of your family, which is requested after the Home Study Application has been approved. A social worker usually has two to four visits with your family, including a home visit to get to know you, your parenting styles, your resources, and your reasons for adopting. The intent of the home study is to assess your family’s readiness and suitability to adopt a child. The Home Study also helps educate and prepare your family for the adoption experience and the child joining your family. The social worker will submit a current home study in compliance with the require ments set up by your state of residence, U.S. government and the foreign country.  Our Agency will provide the social worker with guidelines for preparing your home study and will review your home study to ensure it complies with requirements. DOSSIER: Once your family’s home study is completed, your family will prepare a dossier for submission to the foreign country you have chosen (with the exception of Korea). The dossier is a set of legal documents, which includes your family’s home study and provides information, which helps foreign government officials in determining if your family meets the country’s requirements for adopting a child. We review your family’s dossier documents to ensure they meet country requirements. Depending on the country, our staff may also process the documents and obtain authentication or apostille certificates. CHILD REFERRAL: Our Agency receives information on a child from the foreign country. The child’s information is then presented to your family by your home study social worker or an agency representative. Referral information will include one or more photos of the child, a social and medical history on the child and any medical treatment records and birth family information available. Your family is given at least two weeks to carefully consider the child’s information and to have your physician and other medical specialists review the information before deciding whether to accept the referral of the child. CHILD ASSIGNMENT: This happens after your family accepts a referral of a specific child. Assignment paperwork is sent to the foreign country and the authorities there take the steps necessary for the adoption process to proceed forward. PARENTING EDUCATION: Parenting an adopted child can have unique joys and challenges. We require all adoptive parents to complete a series of education requirements, including several online adoption courses and recommended parenting books prior to receiving their child. Your family will receive the Parent Education Requirements checklist with the Home Study Application. CHILD ARRIVAL: This will depend on whether your family has selected to adopt from a country that allows children to be escorted to the U.S. or whether your family must travel to receive your child. We will notify you when your child is ready to come home and will provide preparation and guidance about travel. POST-PLACEMENT SUPERVISION. This is provided by your family’s home study provider. The first visit must be done within four weeks of your child’s arrival home. Your social worker will assess your family and child’s adjustments to each other and provide support to help with the transition. An additional two to ten visits will be made with your family over a six-month to five-year period, depending on the country. After a minimum of six months, your social worker can recommend the finalization (or re-finalization) of your child’s adoption in the U.S.  In addition, some countries require families to provide periodic update reports for several years after the adoption, sometimes until the child is 18 years old. ADOPTION FINALIZATION: Depending on the country, the adoption may be finalized in the child’s birth country or in the U.S.  Either way, it is important to have the adoption finalized, re-finalized, or recognized in a U.S. court.  We recommend that your family retains an attorney with intercountry adoption experience to assist you with this process and with obtaining a U.S. birth certificate for your child. U.S. CITIZENSHIP: This is the final step in the adoption process. If your child enters the U.S. on an IR4 or IH4 visa, you will submit Form N600 to USCIS to receive a Certificate of U.S. Citizenship for your child after the adoption is finalized in the U.S.  If your child enters the U.S. on a IR3 or IH3 visa, your family will automatically receive your child’s Certificate of U.S. Citizenship usually within 45 days of arriving home.  We require all families to obtain a Certificate of U.S. Citizenship for their child because the certificate is a non-expiring, irrefutable record of your child’s U.S. citizenship."

One of our social workers will tell you about the children and our process, ask you a few questions, and give you the schedules of our orientations so you can take the next step. 2. Come meet us. Come to an orientation after your conversation with a social worker. Orientations in English are held on the first Saturday of the month at the Family Builders Oakland office, 10AM-12PM,  and every second Tuesday 6-8PM at the First Unitarian Universalist Church, 1187 Franklin Street, San Francisco. We host orientations in Spanish as requested. Feel free to bring a person to whom you will be looking for support during and after the process. You’ll learn more about what it is like to adopt a child who is in foster care. One of our social workers will talk with you about the process, how long it takes, and what is required. Of course, there will be time for your questions as well. 3. Intake Meeting. The intake meeting is held in your home with a Family Builders social worker. We will discuss the type of child for whom you would be the most appropriate match, and we will begin to get to know you. We will ask about who lives in your home, what you do for work and fun, how your extended family might feel about your decision to adopt, your beliefs about child rearing, and more. 4. Training and Home study. After the intake interview, our Family Developer will contact you about paperwork and fingerprinting, and you will be invited to participate in our training program (PRIDE,) which must be completed prior to a homestudy. While you are going through the training process, you will also be completing the required paperwork. Once you have turned in a majority of your paperwork you will meet with a social worker for home study interviews. The home study consists of a series of visits with you during which we ask you questions so we may make a thorough assessment of such issues as your: Marital and relationship history; Living Environment; Growing up History; Mental Health; Education and Work History; References; Why you want to adopt; Knowledge of child development; Understanding of adoption issues. It’s important to be forthcoming and honest. The home study is our way of getting to know you even better so we may assess your unique strengths and those areas where you may need help later on in the process. We use this information to match you with a child whose needs you can meet. This part of the process usually takes 4-6 months. 5. Finding the right match. After your training is finished and your home study has been approved, it is time to begin the search for your child. This process can take some time, so please be patient! Family Builders’ staff will work with you very closely during your search for a child. 6. Meet your child. Once you and your social worker agree that your family can meet the needs of the child you have identified, you will meet with the child’s county social worker and be given as much information about the child as is available. 7. Visitation Period. You will be given some time to think about what you have heard. If you decide to go ahead with the process, we will set up an initial meeting and a schedule for visitation with the child. 8. Fostering Period. After the visitation period, the child will be placed in your home as a foster placement (this is why we call the process “fost-adopt”), and we will work with you to insure the best possible transition for your entire family. During this time a social worker will visit with you regularly and be available to you to assist with case management. 9. Finalizing Your Adoption. After the child has been in your home for a minimum of six months, and when your social worker, the child’s county worker, and you decide that you are ready to proceed, and all legal aspects are in order, you can move to finalize your adoption. Once your adoption is final, you, as an adoptive parent, are regarded and treated in all aspects as the legal parent of the child, with all the same rights and responsibilities of birth parents. For most families it takes between 12 and 18 months from the time the child is placed until an adoption is finalized."

We specialize in private infant adoptions and public concurrent adoptions (fost/adopt) of children placed in our social service system. These children’s ages range from infant to elementary and secondary school, and many are adopted as a sibling group.

Home Study. Completing a Home Study is the first formal step after deciding to become adoptive parents. This is the legal documentation required for all domestic adoptions in California. This ensures each family has the highest potential to care for a child through out their lifetime. By getting to know you, this study will helps us find a very special child or sibling group just for you. It also becomes the tool that represents you to be used by placement workers in charge of the children looking for placement. 2. Matching Your Family With a Child. While training and interviewing through the home study process, we are learning your strengths and vision for what child or sibling group you are interested in. Once you become interested in a child, we work with county social workers to determine a possible match. We also present our families at monthly match meetings and to county social workers where we have established relationships. Waiting to find the right child is hard, but we continue preparing and educating you for the challenges ahead. 3. Fitting Into Your Family. Most children start out in your home as a fost-adopt placement. You will be certified as a Hand In Hand Foundation Foster Parent. We provide you with financial support for the child's care, child care training, and counseling for the child and your family as needed. When the child can be legally adopted, and you and the child are ready, we assist you in the completion of the adoption legal process. State law requires that a child live with you for at least six months before adoption is finalized, and the whole process can take up to nine months to a year. We use this as a good season for family bonding. 4. Concurrent Support. During the time of adjustment and integration of children into your family, we provide regular support time with you in your home. Hand in Hand Foundation staff, social workers, family therapists and childcare professionals are there to help you. In some cases the biological parent still has visitations (away from your home) and we will assist you and the child during this process. All these issues are known up front prior to placement to be certain we all have the resources to make the placement work. 5. Finalization. This last step is the most rewarding for all involved. Since adoption is a legal process, we will help you file all the necessary documents, or in some cases where we cooperate with another agency we will walk you through the final process. It is a great time of celebration and we rejoice with you! "

Couples with remaining embryos now have the option to choose the family who receives their embryo donation gift. The embryo adopting family gives birth to their adopted child…Amazing! Nightlight programs also include comprehensive International, Foster care, Domestic and Homestudy services. We assist families in all 50 states with licensed offices in California, Colorado, Georgia, South Carolina, Kentucky, and Oklahoma.

Nightlight provides home study, pre-adoption education and post-adoption services for families residing in states where we are licensed. We recently began offering Foster Adoption in Colorado and California. We look forward to speaking with you soon to help you choose the adoption program that is best for you!";"Adoption: Domestic Adoption, International Adoption, Embryo Adoption ";"Domestic adoption consists of five parts: Adoption Home study: The home study is an evaluation and education process required by the State to determine your preparedness to parent through adoption. A home study consists of three components: paperwork, education and interviews with a social worker. Match/Identification of birthparent: Once your home study is complete and you have been approved to adopt, your profile will be shown to birthparents. Our social worker will work with both the birthparents and the adopting parents to find the best possible match for everyone involved. Relinquishment and Placement: Details are specific to the state in which your child is born. Refer to the Domestic Adoption Information Packet for South Carolina, Colorado or California for details specific to those states. Post Placement: Details are specific to the state where you choose to finalize the adoption. Finalization: Details are specific to the state where you choose to finalize the adoption. International adoption process:Adoption Home study: The home study is an evaluation and education process required by the State to determine your preparedness to parent through adoption. A home study consists of three components: paperwork, education and interviews with a social worker. Nightlight requires that any family adopting through one of our international programs have their home study completed by a Hague accredited agency, even if the adoption is from a non-Hague country. If there is no Hague accredited agency in your area, please contact Nightlight to discuss your options. Dossier: The documents required by the foreign government to allow you to adopt a child from the country. These documents typically must be notarized and finalized with an apostille. Referral: Based on the information you submit in your dossier, the foreign government will issue you an official referral of a child(ren) for adoption. Depending upon the country you are adopting from, you will either travel to the country to receive the referral and meet the child or you will receive information on the child including pictures and medicals prior to travel. Post-Adoption: You will register your child’s passport with the embassy and provide Post-Adoption reports completed by your social worker along with pictures of your child for a period of time after your adoption, as specified by each individual country. Embryo Adoption Process Application Phase: 1. Fill out the Adoptive Parent Application and sign the Agreement for Adoption Services. Mail them to our office along with a current family photo and the application fee. 2. Complete a Homestudy. 3. Contact your doctor to have him/her complete a Snowflakes form (must be on letterhead with an original signature) that confirms you have “no contraindications to pregnancy” and addresses other factors involved with matching. 4. Give your doctor the “Snowflakes Standards for Donor Couples” to review. 5. Create a family profile including pictures of your family, a ‘Dear Genetic Family’ letter, and a short autobiography. Pre-Matching Interview with the Social Worker: Our social worker contacts you to discuss your matching requirements and your preference for contact with the genetic family. Matching Phase: Your profile is sent to a genetic family. If they select you, you receive their Family Profile, medical health history, and embryo information for consideration. You decide to accept or decline the match. Clinic Approval (and possible blood testing): If you are having your embryos sent to your fertility clinic, we send the embryology reports and infectious disease test results from the genetic couple to your fertility doctor. Your doctor informs us if additional lab work is needed before the embryos can be accepted into their facility. If necessary, we will contact and provide your genetic family with a lab order to do additional blood testing. Snowflakes pays for FDA required testing for the genetic parents. You are responsible for the costs of any testing that exceeds FDA requirements. If you would like to travel to your embryos, we can help you look into that opportunity. Contract Phase: You receive an Embryo Adoption Agreement to be signed and notarized designating the adoption of the embryos from the family you have selected. Travel: Snowflakes schedules a travel date for your embryos and they will be sent to your fertility clinic. Alternatively, if you are traveling to your embryos, your travel arrangements can be made at this time. Frozen Embryo Transfer (FET): Arrange with your doctor when your transfer attempt will be scheduled and notify us of the date. After the transfer, notify our office as to the number of embryos thawed, how many survived the thaw and were transferred, and the stage of the transferred embryo(s). We will notify genetic parents unless they decline notification. Pregnancy Test Results:  Typically about two weeks after your transfer, you return to your doctor for a pregnancy test and notify our office of the results. Pregnancy: This is your time to experience the joy of being pregnant! Birth: Congratulations! As soon as possible after your baby is born, notify our office so we can celebrate with you! We inform the genetic family on the joyous outcome unless they decline notification. Post-Adoption: Complete one post adoption report with your social worker six weeks after your baby is born. At three, six, and nine months of age, you will send an update to Snowflakes. Correspondence between you and your genetic family is separate."

The Preliminary Interview. The preliminary interview is scheduled after the orientation, and allows for further discussion about your family’s motives, strengths, and interests in the adoption process. 3. The Application. The application consists of two packets. The first contains the foster/adoption application, fingerprint, and other forms necessary to begin the process. The second packet is focused on you as a family, your experiences with children, your relationships, and helps Sierra to know you better. 4. Classes. Preparation classes provide in-depth exploration of challenges and benefits in caring for children not born to you, and how to successfully parent a child with a history of traumatic losses. Once you have completed the basic training, additional classes and support groups will prepare you for the role of parenting a child from foster care. 5. Foster Certification Process. The certification of your home is mandatory before placement. Dual certification for foster/adopt homes must meet state regulations, including requiring smoke detectors, a fire extinguisher, a locked location for medications and cleaning products, and current driver’s license and insurance. CPR and First Aid trainings must be completed as well. 6. Home Study Process. Home study process begins when the application paperwork has been completed. An experienced Master’s level social worker will be assigned to work with your family throughout the assessment process. Sierra offers personal interviews for your family at your convenience. Once a child is placed in your home, your home study worker will provide ongoing placement support as your family’s case manager."

Whenever possible, Child Welfare Services provides assistance to families to help keep the children safely at home. However, when a child must be removed from his or her caregivers due to neglect, abuse, or abandonment, Child Welfare Services (CWS) will arrange for a temporary home for the child. CWS strives to place all children who must be removed from their caregivers into the least restrictive, most family-like home available. Our best option is to find relatives who are able to take care of the child in their home; our next best option is to place the children temporarily into a licensed foster family home. Our goal is to provide services to the family that will help them reunite with their children. Sadly, this is not always possible or in the best interest of the children due to continued problems at home. When reuniting a family is not possible, CWS works to provide a permanent situation for children, either through guardianship or adoption. Guardians have most of the same legal rights and authority as birth parents, without requiring the termination of parental rights. Guardianship ends when a child turns 18 and is considered an adult. Adoption also provides a child with a permanent and stable family. It is the permanent, legal transfer of parental rights and responsibilities from a child’s biological parents to the adopting parents.";"Foster Care & Adoption";

COURT PROCESS FOR ADOPTIVE PLACEMENTS - Permanency Planning Hearing: Determine a plan for the child. The Court may determine adoption, legal guardianship or long-term foster care. A plan of adoption requires that parental rights be terminated at this hearing. State Acknowledgement: The County will submit documents to the State to release the child for adoption. Adoption Signing: The County sets up a meeting with the private agency adoption social worker (Walden adoption social worker). Finalization Process: Walden adoption social worker collaborates with the County to complete Court Finalization Paperwork. Court Finalization: The adoption is finalized in court, a new birth certificate if ordered and the adoptive family may use court papers for all legal purposes until a new birth certificate is received. MATCHING - Once you have become a certified adoptive parent, the matching process may begin. It is possible that a foster child in your home may become free for adoption and you will begin the process with this match. Otherwise, Walden will assist you with locating an adoptive match. This process very interactive and we will be in frequent contact with you to discuss potential matches. During the matching process, your home study and family book will be presented to county adoption workers throughout California. Walden adoption workers regularly attend meetings where county adoption workers from many counties gather to review the home studies and picture books of waiting adoptive families. In addition, we are in nearly constant contact with local and regional county adoption workers who are looking for possible matches for adoptive children. PLACEMENT - When a potential match has been identified, one of our adoption workers will accompany you to a Disclosure meeting or Telling with the county adoption worker. By law, the legal custodian of the child (the County) must disclose information about the child to families pursuing adoption. At the time of the adoption placement signing, the adoptive family will receive hardcopies of information that had been previously disclosed, as well as any additional information that has been obtained. During a Disclosure meeting or Telling the county adoption worker for the adoptive child will meet with the family in order to provide information regarding the following: Reasons why the child was removed and current assessment; Medical history of the adoptive child; Any behavioral problems or other concerns; Parental history of the biological father and mother; Other information that has been provided regarding the child and/or biological family. This is also an opportunity for the county adoption worker to meet with you face to face and discuss aspects of your home study. As part of the home study process, we will prepare you for what questions to expect during this meeting. After disclosure, if the decision is made to move forward, a pre-placement visit will generally be arranged. This visit may take place in the adoptive child's current foster home or a neutral setting such as a park or restaurant. Depending on the age of the child, these visits may progress to overnight visits at your home, or an immediate placement. POST PLACEMENT - A minimum of 6 months after the initial placement, the identified adoptive child is technically still considered a foster child regardless of their court status, even if they are legally freed for adoption. During this time we render our extensive post-placement support services, including:  Weekly or Bi-weekly visits to your home; 4 Hour on-call availability; Individual child assessment; Family counseling; Development of community resources; Educational planning and development; Counseling planning; Parenting skills. During this time you will also receive a monthly reimbursement at standard foster care rates to help offset expenditures.

Our friendly, knowledgeable staff is here for you every step of the way. The process begins with an orientation to introduce you to WCC, our mission, and our foster and foster-adopt programs as well as to answer any questions you have. At that point, if you are interested in moving forward with the process, you will complete an application and sign up for one of our MAPP (Model Approach to Partnerships in Parenting) courses. Step 2: Getting to know you. In order to become certified, all interested foster parents must complete a MAPP course, a 21-hour, seven-week training offered four times a year and designed to: Prepare prospective foster parents to care for foster children; Prepare prospective foster parents to work with children’s families of origin as they work to reunify with their children; Help potential foster parents decided whether becoming a foster parent is right path for them. During this course, WCC will provide facilitate the process for every adult living in the home to obtain a fingerprint background check, including the Child Abuse Index. In addition, the family will be asked to provide background information on each family member. Lastly, one of WCC’s licensed clinical social workers will perform a family assessment, or “home study,” to ensure that your home and your family are prepared for a foster child to join you. The social worker will conduct individual and family interviews and walk with you through your home to show you what needs to be done to satisfy state regulations. This home study is a perfect opportunity for you to ask any questions or bring up any concerns that you may have. This process of certification can take anywhere from three to six months from the time you begin the MAPP course. Step 3: Making connections. We love helping to build happy, loving families for children in need. WCC carefully matches the needs of each child with the strengths of our certified foster parents. The length of time this step takes depends on the stated criteria of the foster parents."

Please consider making someone’s dream come true.";"Adoption: International Adoption";"Stage I: Research and Decision-Making. Before diving into an adoption process, it helps to read, research, and talk to as many people as you can about their experiences to understand whether international adoption is for you. Evaluate domestic and international adoption processes and compare the two. If you feel the rewards of international adoption - typically quicker process, irrevocable finalization abroad, choosing your own child and sometimes even saving a life - outweigh the risks, it’s time to evaluate in more detail what is involved. Different countries pose different requirements and constraints, so it is best to choose a few that fit you best and establish an order of preference. Your evaluation criteria might be: Country requirements. Some countries restrict foreign adoptive parent candidates based on age, health, marital status, etc. The first question in evaluating a country program is whether you would qualify. Children available. If you are looking for an infant or newborn, many countries may not be an option as children there might be unavailable for international adoption at birth or be adopted domestically at a young age. Of course, ethnicity and gender of the desired child may also affect your choice of country programs. Time involved. Are you willing to wait for a year or more to bring a child home? How many trips can you make and how long can you stay abroad to finalize the adoption without sacrificing your job? Today, some countries require adoptive parents to stay several weeks in-country to complete the adoption, while others still offer escort options. Finances involved. Everyone agrees international adoption is costly, though many compare the cost of adoption to that of a new car and for them there is no question as to what is more valuable. But all families have different budgets. It may cost $2,000 to $4,000 to compile a dossier (a package of documents sent to foreign authorities to process your adoption, including home study and immigration documents). It is then another $3,000 to $5,000 for state-side international adoption agency assistance. These costs might be about the same across all country programs, though of course different agency fees might vary. However, foreign fees and travel expenses vary significantly from country to country, and cost of providing post-placement reports may also be different. Risks involved. This is not a quantitative criteria that could easily be compared across programs. You may have to research personal stories more to learn if there have been many failed adoptions recently and why — was it agencies’ fault, regional issues or overall change in country policies and laws. There is no such thing as a risk-free international adoption, but knowing what you are facing helps make better decision. Stage II: Choosing An Agency. Now that you have decided on an international adoption and selected a few countries as possible choices, you need to find at least one agency to help you. You need to find a licensed adoption agency near you to conduct a home study, a comprehensive report about your background, family composition, clearances, etc. A few countries may allow home studies to be done by independent licensed social workers, but those are typically exceptions rather than rules. If an agency conducting your homestudy has international programs, you may complete your adoption through them, or you may choose a different agency for the merits of their programs, track record, etc. Although it may seem comforting to work with an agency nearby that you can meet face to face with, sometimes it is worth going with an agency across the country that has better success rate of problem-free completed adoptions. There are many questions parents are recommended to ask before settling on an agency. But most importantly, you need to interview the references given by each agency and examine other resources that can provide an unbiased reference; do an internet search, contact BBB, maybe even the state licensing board to check if there are any complaints against the agency. Stage III: Preparing A Dossier. Once you have applied with an agency that will conduct your home study, you are given a list of documents to be provided, forms to be filled out, and in some states, education sessions to attend. A home study, however, is just a portion of your international adoption dossier, and it may be best to concentrate on the homestudy checklist before proceeding with the rest of the paperwork. The agency with an international program you sign up with presents you with an additional checklist of documents and forms. Some of them may seem redundant to those required in the home study, but required as original or certified copies by foreign authorities anyway. All the documents in your dossier would need to be authenticated by notary, apostille or certification and possibly embassy authentication, before accepted by the foreign country. Your agency takes care of translating your dossier and submitting it to foreign authorities. At this point all you can do is wait. Stage IV: Evaluating and Accepting Referral. Some countries provide information about available child(ren) fitting your requirements after receiving and processing your dossier. When adopting from one of those countries, a family would receive a photo, sometimes a video, and some medical information on a child they are offered to adopt. A family might seek a medical opinion of an international adoption doctor, more research on the internet, etc., to make a decision on whether to accept or reject a referral. In other countries, families are required to travel “blind” and to choose from children available for adoption at the time of arrival. Stage V: Traveling To Adopt. Practically all countries require one or both parents to travel to the country of adoption to finalize it in court or any other administrative hearing and to bring their child home. Some countries require U.S. citizens to obtain visas in advance, some don’t. Some countries have a prolonged process with so much time between required parental presence that most families choose to make two trips. Adoption trips don’t always come with advanced notice or last the expected number of days, so flexibility in planning is key. In-country coordinators are typically doing everything they can to process your adoption, but red tape and politics may cause some unexpected delays. One thing is for sure — your adoption trip(s) experience would almost surely be one to remember and cherish. Stage VI: Coming Home. When you come home with your child, one of the first things to do would be to get his or her Social Security number. With that, you can add your child’s information to the health insurance, visit a pediatrician and a dentist, schedule tests and immunizations as needed. Among the million things to do – enrolling in school or daycare, going shopping, introducing your new son or daughter to the new world – please don’t forget to fulfill your adoptive country’s registration obligations, if any, to ensure other families after you would be allowed to bring their kids home, too."

We have placed more than 9,000 children in loving homes throughout the United States. Hand In Hand is a Christian-based, non-denominational adoption agency, Hague-accredited and licensed to place children throughout the United States. Hand In Hand International Adoptions began its office in Colorado 37 years ago, originally as Cribs, Inc and then incorporating as Hand In Hand in 1980. Hand In Hand is honored to be among the select group of initial agencies in Colorado to achieve Hague Accreditation. While Colorado is home to many adoption agencies, Hand In Hand prides itself on the level of individual attention we provide our families as we walk them through the entire adoption process from information meetings through court validation/finalization and beyond. Because of the relationships we build with the families we work with, we are able to offer post adoption support through phone calls, resource lists, education opportunities, and agency events. The Colorado office of Hand In Hand has welcomed children home from all over the world including: China, Guatemala, Haiti, Honduras, Mexico, Moldova, Peru, Russia, the Philippines, and Thailand. While located in Colorado Springs, the Colorado office also provided domestic adoption services. We are looking forward to continuing to welcome children home through our active programs in China and the Philippines as well as our newer programs in Bulgaria and Brazil. Originally located in Colorado Springs, Colorado, and then Estes Park, Colorado, the current Hand In Hand office is now located in Fort Collins, Colorado. Fort Collins, Colorado is located 65 miles north of Denver, Colorado and is home to Colorado State University nestled up against the foothills of the Colorado Rocky Mountains. Fort Collins is known for the healthy and active lifestyle of its residents and the university small town atmosphere.

Our orientation sites, dates and times are listed on our news page, or you may contact the office nearest you for more information. If you reside in another state, you may request an information packet or contact our administrative office in Tucson, Arizona, and you will work directly with the Hand In Hand Program Director for your desired country. Step 2: If you choose to adopt through Hand In Hand, you must submit a completed application with application fee, a copy of your most recent tax return, a signed fee agreement for the specific country, a signed disclosure statement, and a snapshot photo of you and your family. Step 3: Upon receipt and acceptance of your application, Hand In Hand will send you an invitation to attend our mandatory pre-adoptive parent group training sessions (if you reside in Arizona, Colorado, Florida, Indiana or Minnesota). The agency requires 30-35 hours of training, with the structure of the training varying with the state. If you reside in a state other than Arizona, Colorado, Florida, Indiana or Minnesota, training will be provided by the licensed agency in your state that will be doing your home study. Areas of education provided by Hand In Hand include Immigration, the home study process, paperwork processing, types of children available, attachment and bonding, trans-racial and trans-cultural adoptions, medical considerations, core issues in adoption, parenting skills, and more. Step 4: With our guidance, you will be busy collecting medical reports, original birth certificates, marriage/divorce certificates, employment verification, physical examination forms, and other documents needed to build your dossier. Each country has its own requirements for dossier documents, and we will assist you with each one. Step 5: Once a portion of your required documents have been turned in, a home study will be scheduled with a licensed social worker. The home study visit is done in the informal atmosphere of your home. The home study is one of the pillars of the adoption case, as it goes to Immigration, your state of residence, and to the foreign country. If you reside in a state other than Arizona, Colorado, Florida, Indiana or Minnesota, you will locate a licensed agency in your state to complete the home study. If you need assistance or a list of possible agencies, Hand In Hand can help. Step 6: Upon dossier completion, Hand In Hand will complete all necessary legalizations and authentications of your documents. The dossier will then be sent to the respective country for review, acceptance and matching with a child. With a match, you will see pictures of the child and a case study (some countries provide a video of the child). Acceptance of the match is your decision. This is a lifetime commitment that you are making, and we want you to make the best decision for this child. If you need more time or have additional questions, we will work with the foreign country to attempt to get the answers for you. While you are making this decision, Hand In Hand is available to discuss any concerns or questions you may have or to discuss possible resources. Step 7: Upon match acceptance, the country is notified and the process is initiated for preparing to travel to get your child. The time frame from match acceptance to travel for placement will vary with each country. Step 8: A travel meeting will be scheduled with your Hand In Hand adoption specialist or program director. During this meeting, we will help you prepare for the trip, make travel arrangements, and understand the adoption finalization process. We have liaisons in each country with which we work who will meet you at the airport in the foreign country and assist you throughout your stay. Step 9: Finally! You will travel to the country to meet your child and will have the assistance of a representative, who will also help with the legal process in that country. Step 10: You and your wonderful child (or children) will head home with either a guardianship or a final decree of adoption, depending upon the host country. Step 11: A series of scheduled post placement visits and reports will be done by your social worker. The first visit is done within two weeks to one month after you return home. At this visit, we ask that you provide us with photos of your child to forward to the country with each required report. These post placement visits are meant to provide you with support, adjustment help, and finally to thank the country for making the decision to place the child internationally. When we show the foreign countries that adoptions are successful, it keeps the doors open for many more children to find their forever homes.  Step 12: Depending on the laws of your country and state, we ask that you go to court six or twelve months after returning home for the purpose of validating your child’s adoption in the U.S.  Step 13: We will assist you in obtaining a new birth certificate, a Social Security number, and citizenship documentation. Step 14: You’re ready to start again! And many of our families do, as close to 50% of families opt to adopt through Hand In Hand a second or even third time!"

A home study consists of three components: paperwork, education and interviews with a social worker. Match/Identification of birthparent: Once your home study is complete and you have been approved to adopt, your profile will be shown to birthparents. Our social worker will work with both the birthparents and the adopting parents to find the best possible match for everyone involved. Relinquishment and Placement: Details are specific to the state in which your child is born. Refer to the Domestic Adoption Information Packet for South Carolina, Colorado or California for details specific to those states. Post Placement: Details are specific to the state where you choose to finalize the adoption. Finalization: Details are specific to the state where you choose to finalize the adoption. International adoption process:Adoption Home study: The home study is an evaluation and education process required by the State to determine your preparedness to parent through adoption. A home study consists of three components: paperwork, education and interviews with a social worker. Nightlight requires that any family adopting through one of our international programs have their home study completed by a Hague accredited agency, even if the adoption is from a non-Hague country. If there is no Hague accredited agency in your area, please contact Nightlight to discuss your options. Dossier: The documents required by the foreign government to allow you to adopt a child from the country. These documents typically must be notarized and finalized with an apostille. Referral: Based on the information you submit in your dossier, the foreign government will issue you an official referral of a child(ren) for adoption. Depending upon the country you are adopting from, you will either travel to the country to receive the referral and meet the child or you will receive information on the child including pictures and medicals prior to travel. Post-Adoption: You will register your child’s passport with the embassy and provide Post-Adoption reports completed by your social worker along with pictures of your child for a period of time after your adoption, as specified by each individual country. Embryo Adoption Process Application Phase: 1. Fill out the Adoptive Parent Application and sign the Agreement for Adoption Services. Mail them to our office along with a current family photo and the application fee. 2. Complete a Homestudy. 3. Contact your doctor to have him/her complete a Snowflakes form (must be on letterhead with an original signature) that confirms you have “no contraindications to pregnancy” and addresses other factors involved with matching. 4. Give your doctor the “Snowflakes Standards for Donor Couples” to review. 5. Create a family profile including pictures of your family, a ‘Dear Genetic Family’ letter, and a short autobiography. Pre-Matching Interview with the Social Worker: Our social worker contacts you to discuss your matching requirements and your preference for contact with the genetic family. Matching Phase: Your profile is sent to a genetic family. If they select you, you receive their Family Profile, medical health history, and embryo information for consideration. You decide to accept or decline the match. Clinic Approval (and possible blood testing): If you are having your embryos sent to your fertility clinic, we send the embryology reports and infectious disease test results from the genetic couple to your fertility doctor. Your doctor informs us if additional lab work is needed before the embryos can be accepted into their facility. If necessary, we will contact and provide your genetic family with a lab order to do additional blood testing. Snowflakes pays for FDA required testing for the genetic parents. You are responsible for the costs of any testing that exceeds FDA requirements. If you would like to travel to your embryos, we can help you look into that opportunity. Contract Phase: You receive an Embryo Adoption Agreement to be signed and notarized designating the adoption of the embryos from the family you have selected. Travel: Snowflakes schedules a travel date for your embryos and they will be sent to your fertility clinic. Alternatively, if you are traveling to your embryos, your travel arrangements can be made at this time. Frozen Embryo Transfer (FET): Arrange with your doctor when your transfer attempt will be scheduled and notify us of the date. After the transfer, notify our office as to the number of embryos thawed, how many survived the thaw and were transferred, and the stage of the transferred embryo(s). We will notify genetic parents unless they decline notification. Pregnancy Test Results:  Typically about two weeks after your transfer, you return to your doctor for a pregnancy test and notify our office of the results. Pregnancy: This is your time to experience the joy of being pregnant! Birth: Congratulations! As soon as possible after your baby is born, notify our office so we can celebrate with you! We inform the genetic family on the joyous outcome unless they decline notification. Post-Adoption: Complete one post adoption report with your social worker six weeks after your baby is born. At three, six, and nine months of age, you will send an update to Snowflakes. Correspondence between you and your genetic family is separate."

Children need parents and we’ve connected those needs and wishes through adoption for many.  We believe a child grows best in a family life environment rich with love and security and opportunities and advantages for the child to experience and create a successful life. The children available for adoption have been placed due to social and economic reasons. Contrary to public thought, birthmothers decide upon adoption because they love their children and have a special kind of love that enables them to put their children’s  lives ahead of their own life.  Adoption is a responsible way for a birthmother to provide for her child when circumstances find her unable to do all that is required to meet her child’s many needs for stability and security in a family life environment. The majority of birthmothers and adoptive couples acknowledge the many emotions and fears inherent in adoption and at the same time are quick to add it was all so worth it.  The birthmother finds reassurance and peace that her child has become part of a loving and prepared family and the adoptive couple realizes their dream of being parents and sharing their love and resources with their child.

We feel our adoptions are most successful when we allow the people involved to give input about the adoption process. As a result, most of our adoptions are semi-open, by meeting with their birth parents, spending time at the hospital before they have to say goodbye, and remaining in contact through pictures and updates; And know that you gave your baby a life that you could not provide for them. Others are closed with no contact. We know finding the right adoption professional is a difficult decision. We ask you to check us out before you make your decision.

This first meeting gives us a chance to get to know each other. You’ll learn more about adoption and our agency, and we'll learn more about you and your expectations. That way, we can help you make some important decisions and guide you toward the domestic or international program that best matches your needs. If you’d like, we’ll give you a preliminary application at this meeting. 2. Application. Whenever you’re ready, you may complete the disclosure, the application and send them along with a 600.00 fee (1,000 fee for out-of-state families) and picture of yourselves. Just give us a call if you have questions along the way. Once the preliminary application is received, you will receive a full application packet and instruction to complete the packet. 3. Home Study Preparation. After we receive your completed application packet, we will assign you a caseworker that will support and advise you throughout the entire adoption process. Your caseworker will also compile your Home Study, a report that is required before you can adopt a child. The Home Study is based on a variety of information, including medical and reference checks, interviews with family members and at least one visit to your home. If you choose to adopt through our Domestic Infant Program, you will also need to create a profile - a letter illustrated with photos that tells prospective birthparents a little about you, your home and your lifestyle. 4. Adoption Education. Adoption Resources offers an excellent adoption education course for all prospective adoptive parents. During these classes, you’ll discuss a wide variety of adoption related topics and learn about the different types of adoptions available to you. This course also offers many opportunities to discuss your questions and concerns and to meet and talk with other waiting families. 5. Placement. After your paperwork is completed, you’re ready to be matched with a child. You will wait to be selected by a birthmother. You’ll then wait for the birth of the baby. 6. Post-placement. Your child is home! During the next six months, your caseworker will visit you up to four times to make sure that your family is adjusting well. Post-placement visits are required and they must be completed prior to the finalization process. These visits also give you a chance to ask questions, share concerns - and show off your child."

If you reside within the same geographic area of either of our offices a member of our professional staff will complete your required home study. If you live outside of this area we will assist you in retaining a licensed social worker or agency to perform your home study for you. During your home study, a social worker will visit your home and meet all members of your household. Our goal is to assist you in finding a child who will complement your family and adjust to your lifestyle. You will be required to submit to a criminal and abuse registry background check. You will be asked to provide personal and professional references and visit your doctor for a check up. (The whole process, although very thorough, sounds much worse than it actually is). The educational component of your home study provides you with a broad overview of the children who are available for adoption and helps you understand their medical, psychological, developmental, and educational needs. At the conclusion of this process, you will come away with a detailed, narrative that advocates for your family and opens the door of your home to the right child who best compliments your own personal parenting style. Once a match is made, our social workers will take a personal interest in your birth mother. We will assist her in making doctor appointments, and in most instances attend these apointments with her. We request copies of all medical records and provide these records to you. We will help her to sort through her feelings. We help her set new goals and provide assistance with educational and vocational training. We conduct random drug testing to assure that she is taking proper care of herself and the unborn child. We help her find affordable housing and provide referals for community resources. We are there for her and for you for as long as needed. We also coordinate and attend meetings and telephone calls between you and your birth mother when appropriate and work with both you and your birth mother to craft a hospital plan that takes into consideration the feelings and emotional needs of all involved. Our staff attorney provides all adoption-related legal services, at no additional charge including personal representation at all court appearances. After placement, we will make visits to your home to evaluate how well you and your new child are adjusting to eachother. We will provide all required documentation of the adjustment process for the child’s state of origin. Furthermore, we will facilitate and coordinate necessary community resources to provide you with any needed support during the adjustment period.

We have placed more than 9,000 children in loving homes throughout the United States. Hand In Hand is a Christian-based, non-denominational adoption agency, Hague-accredited and licensed to place children throughout the United States. The Florida office for the adoption agency Hand in Hand International Adoptions is in Ocala, Florida. Ocala, Florida is approximately 75 miles northwest of Orlando, Florida. Ocala is the county seat for Marion County and is located in the central part of Florida. This makes it easy for the agency to provide services throughout the State of Florida. The office is located on the property of the CEO and founder of Hand in Hand International Adoptions, MaryLee Lane.";"International Adoption Placement and Homestudy Services";"Step 1: If you reside in one of the states in which Hand In Hand has licensed offices (Arizona, Colorado, Florida, Indiana, or Minnesota) we invite you to attend a free orientation hosted by Hand In Hand. Our orientation sites, dates and times are listed on our news page, or you may contact the office nearest you for more information. If you reside in another state, you may request an information packet or contact our administrative office in Tucson, Arizona, and you will work directly with the Hand In Hand Program Director for your desired country. Step 2: If you choose to adopt through Hand In Hand, you must submit a completed application with application fee, a copy of your most recent tax return, a signed fee agreement for the specific country, a signed disclosure statement, and a snapshot photo of you and your family. Step 3: Upon receipt and acceptance of your application, Hand In Hand will send you an invitation to attend our mandatory pre-adoptive parent group training sessions (if you reside in Arizona, Colorado, Florida, Indiana or Minnesota). The agency requires 30-35 hours of training, with the structure of the training varying with the state. If you reside in a state other than Arizona, Colorado, Florida, Indiana or Minnesota, training will be provided by the licensed agency in your state that will be doing your home study. Areas of education provided by Hand In Hand include Immigration, the home study process, paperwork processing, types of children available, attachment and bonding, trans-racial and trans-cultural adoptions, medical considerations, core issues in adoption, parenting skills, and more. Step 4: With our guidance, you will be busy collecting medical reports, original birth certificates, marriage/divorce certificates, employment verification, physical examination forms, and other documents needed to build your dossier. Each country has its own requirements for dossier documents, and we will assist you with each one. Step 5: Once a portion of your required documents have been turned in, a home study will be scheduled with a licensed social worker. The home study visit is done in the informal atmosphere of your home. The home study is one of the pillars of the adoption case, as it goes to Immigration, your state of residence, and to the foreign country. If you reside in a state other than Arizona, Colorado, Florida, Indiana or Minnesota, you will locate a licensed agency in your state to complete the home study. If you need assistance or a list of possible agencies, Hand In Hand can help. Step 6: Upon dossier completion, Hand In Hand will complete all necessary legalizations and authentications of your documents. The dossier will then be sent to the respective country for review, acceptance and matching with a child. With a match, you will see pictures of the child and a case study (some countries provide a video of the child). Acceptance of the match is your decision. This is a lifetime commitment that you are making, and we want you to make the best decision for this child. If you need more time or have additional questions, we will work with the foreign country to attempt to get the answers for you. While you are making this decision, Hand In Hand is available to discuss any concerns or questions you may have or to discuss possible resources. Step 7: Upon match acceptance, the country is notified and the process is initiated for preparing to travel to get your child. The time frame from match acceptance to travel for placement will vary with each country. Step 8: A travel meeting will be scheduled with your Hand In Hand adoption specialist or program director. During this meeting, we will help you prepare for the trip, make travel arrangements, and understand the adoption finalization process. We have liaisons in each country with which we work who will meet you at the airport in the foreign country and assist you throughout your stay. Step 9: Finally! You will travel to the country to meet your child and will have the assistance of a representative, who will also help with the legal process in that country. Step 10: You and your wonderful child (or children) will head home with either a guardianship or a final decree of adoption, depending upon the host country. Step 11: A series of scheduled post placement visits and reports will be done by your social worker. The first visit is done within two weeks to one month after you return home. At this visit, we ask that you provide us with photos of your child to forward to the country with each required report. These post placement visits are meant to provide you with support, adjustment help, and finally to thank the country for making the decision to place the child internationally. When we show the foreign countries that adoptions are successful, it keeps the doors open for many more children to find their forever homes.  Step 12: Depending on the laws of your country and state, we ask that you go to court six or twelve months after returning home for the purpose of validating your child’s adoption in the U.S.  Step 13: We will assist you in obtaining a new birth certificate, a Social Security number, and citizenship documentation. Step 14: You’re ready to start again! And many of our families do, as close to 50% of families opt to adopt through Hand In Hand a second or even third time!"

The greatest effort spent on each couple will be the home study. A home study is a series of interviews in which the social worker concentrates on collecting information via face-to-face contact with each couple. The home study typically consists of an orientation interview followed by 4 home study interviews. 1. The first interview is a home visit in which the social worker will address each of the qualifications for adoption. This is a joint interview. 2. The next visits are individual interviews and are typically held at the LCS office. Both spouses may come on the same day, if they must travel to get to the office. If they are local, each spouse may schedule his or her own interview at his convenience. The interviews will be autobiographical in nature and will be based on an Autobiography written by the applicant. The social worker will ask that you complete this Autobiography prior to this interview. 3. The third interview will focus on parenting philosophies and plans. Issues such as experience and exposure to children, the applicants’ parenting received when they were children, values and discipline will be explored. 4. The fourth interview will focus on adoption education. We will discuss how to educate the child on his or her adoptive status, how to educate others, proper words and timing, books on adoption, trans-racial adoptions, contact with birth parents, background information on any prospective adopted child, completing a profile and many other issues common to adoption. Education is a very important part of the home study process. Each family in the domestic program is required to attend Lifeline’s domestic adoption conference in Birmingham, Alabama. This conference is a two day interactive training which will prepare and equip families for the joys and challenges of domestic adoption. After the home study process is completed, families will begin the matching process. Each family will create a family profile. Family profile’s are shown based on the birth mother’s preferences. Lifeline requires that at a minimum adoptive couples be willing to meet the birth mother before the adoption takes place, and to send correspondence through Lifeline to the birth family after the placement."

Welcome/Intake. This first meeting gives us a chance to get to know each other. You’ll learn more about adoption and our agency, and we'll learn more about you and your expectations. That way, we can help you make some important decisions and guide you toward the domestic or international program that best matches your needs. If you’d like, we’ll give you a preliminary application at this meeting. 2. Application. Whenever you’re ready, you may complete the disclosure, the application and send them along with a 600.00 fee (1,000 fee for out-of-state families) and picture of yourselves. Just give us a call if you have questions along the way. Once the preliminary application is received, you will receive a full application packet and instruction to complete the packet. 3. Home Study Preparation. After we receive your completed application packet, we will assign you a caseworker that will support and advise you throughout the entire adoption process. Your caseworker will also compile your Home Study, a report that is required before you can adopt a child. The Home Study is based on a variety of information, including medical and reference checks, interviews with family members and at least one visit to your home. If you choose to adopt through our Domestic Infant Program, you will also need to create a profile - a letter illustrated with photos that tells prospective birthparents a little about you, your home and your lifestyle. 4. Adoption Education. Adoption Resources offers an excellent adoption education course for all prospective adoptive parents. During these classes, you’ll discuss a wide variety of adoption related topics and learn about the different types of adoptions available to you. This course also offers many opportunities to discuss your questions and concerns and to meet and talk with other waiting families. 5. Placement. After your paperwork is completed, you’re ready to be matched with a child. You will wait to be selected by a birthmother. You’ll then wait for the birth of the baby. 6. Post-placement. Your child is home! During the next six months, your caseworker will visit you up to four times to make sure that your family is adjusting well. Post-placement visits are required and they must be completed prior to the finalization process. These visits also give you a chance to ask questions, share concerns - and show off your child."

Some women facing an unplanned pregnancy are unsure if they are ready to parent and begin looking into adoption. Every woman’s situation is different, and only you know what’s right for your baby – not the father, your parents, your sister or your best friend. Step 2 - Creating an Adoption Plan. At American Adoptions, you are in charge of the adoption process. Your Adoption Specialist will ask you about your ideal adoptive family, the type of contact you wish to share with the family, the type of contact you wish to share with your child, how you envision the hospital stay, and much more. Your answers to each of these questions will allow us to develop your “adoption plan,"" which will allow us to find the best adoption situation tailored specifically to your wishes. Step 3 - Finding an Adoptive Family. Because we have hundreds of waiting adoptive families, you are sure to find the family who will provide your baby with the best life possible.

Our focus is on the children who wait longest for families.  We are comminted to increasing awareness in Georgia about the need for adoptive families.  We provide an intense process of preparing families to adopt older children, help match families wih waiting children, and provide close support to families after a child is placed in the home.  All God's Children, Inc. works in partnership with the Georgia Department of Human Services to find families for Georgia's waiting children.  All God's Children also assists in the placement of waiting children in state custody elsewhere in the United States.";"Adoption";"Inquiry: Call us or complete an online inquiry form.  The staff of All God's Children can provide more information about the children we serve and other questions you may have. Application: You may submit your Application to Adopt any time after you receive your information packet in the mail. When your completed application is received, our director will review the application and assign an adoption caseworker to your family. Training: The next step is pre-service training for families who are interested in moving forward in their plans to become adoptive parents. PATH (Parents as Tender Healers) training allows prospective parents to explore adoption issues and learn more about parenting children with a history of losses.  PATH training is offered on Saturdays. There is no charge for the training.  Please contact All God's Children to find out when the next PATH training is scheduled. Home Study: Your adoption caseworker will then meet with you and your family to complete your family assessment or homestudy.  Required documentation you must provide includes physical exams, drug screens, criminal background checks, verification of marriages and divorces, and proof of income, as well as personal references. The interview process is a chance for the caseworker to learn about you and your family while you learn about the children who need homes. A homestudy document is written at the end of the training and assessment process. It describes your family and your abilities to parent adopted children. The completion of training and your homestudy document takes 8 to 12 weeks. Matching: Your family assessment will be presented to social workers throughout Georgia and the United States. The time it takes for a placement will depend on your skills and experience and your openness to school-aged children or children with special needs. Waiting for a child can be a frustrating time for families eager to adopt. Children’s workers who make placement decisions are always looking for the family with the greatest skills to meet the particular child’s needs. Placement and Beyond: Your adoption worker will maintain close contact with your family after placement and will offer assistance, guidance, and support until the adoption is legally finalized. The worker will visit you once or twice a month between placement and finalization. All God's Children believes that adoption is a lifelong process and will remain available to you and your family as future needs arise."

We found that far too many of these children were further traumatized by an adoption that failed and resulted in their return to state custody. We wanted to do something. Then in 2011, a small adoption agency, The Giving Tree, approached CHRIS Kids seeking “adoption”. In The Giving Tree, CHRIS Kids saw the opportunity to build on its strengths, commitment to inclusiveness dedication to eliminate adoption barriers, and to leverage its mission for the development of a trauma informed model of adoptions that would increase the permanency of adoptions. In short, we saw potential to be unlocked so that children could truly be adopted in to safe, loving, permanent families. After a period of “visitation and placement,” The Giving Tree was adopted by CHRIS Kids into our Family of Services on January 1, 2013.";"Adoption Services";"1. Submit an Adoption Interest Form 2.

Story";;;;"SStory@covenantcareadoptions.com";"http://www.covenantcareadoptions.com/";"Covenant Care Services is a state licensed, non-profit Christian adoption agency that has been providing adoption services to women, children and families in Georgia since 1989. Our State Administrative Office is in Macon, and we have staff strategically located throughout Georgia so that we can meet our clients where they are. At Covenant Care Services we approach adoption as a Gospel ministry. We work to serve women, children, and adoptive families with excellence and in a way that is informed and shaped by the Gospel of Jesus Christ. We want the quality of our services and the motivations that drive us to be distinct from other social service providers because of our faith in Jesus. As Christians, we believe that our understanding of what physical adoption ought to look like is informed and shaped by what God has already done for us in the Gospel. Scripture tells us that, “In love [God] predestined us for adoption as sons through Jesus Christ,” and that the entire reason for Jesus’ life and ministry was “so that we might receive adoption as sons” (Ephesians 1:4-5; Galatians 4:5). The concept of adoption is something that originated with God Himself! Such a magnificent foundation has tremendous implications for how we work to enable the adoption of children. When you choose to work with Covenant Care, you are choosing an adoption agency that keeps these grand truths at the center of all that we do.";"Adoption Services ";"Step 1. Contact the Covenant Care office to request a Pre-Application packet. Return the completed packet to Covenant Care, including a signed “Statement of Faith,” “Pro-Life Statement” and “Church Concurrence Form”. Step 2. Prospective Adoptive Families are required by Georgia law to have criminal background clearances from the GBI and the FBI. All other household members 18 and over are also required to complete these clearances.  Please wait for instructions from our office personnel concerning this procedure. You will be contacted once your Pre-Application has been processed; please complete the process immediately as it can take weeks or months to process with the FBI. Step 3. Attend a Covenant Care Training Sessions with approximately 10 to 15 other families to understand more thoroughly what adoption with CCS looks like. We typically have 2 groups of Training Sessions each year. Crucial to a healthy adoption experience is for each family to participate in our Information Training Meetings for adoptive families. Each family will understand what is required of them as they journey through the adoption process and will attend two meetings (Session I & Session II). They will hear testimonies from adoptive couples, birth parents and staff as they explain the different types of adoption experiences. Step 4. After attending these meetings, you will begin the Home Assessment Process. Depending on the caseworker’s and the couple’s availability, this process should take up to 3 months to complete. Step 5. Complete your portfolio of pictures and your birth parent letter so your Adoptive Family Profile can be available to our birth mothers. Step 6. As each family completes this process through Covenant Care, please feel free to pursue other agencies or other adoption avenues that may be available. Step 7. Adoptive Family Profiles are previewed by prospective birth parents that choose the family for their child. An Adoptive Family is not usually aware of when their profile is shown to birthmothers, but will be informed as the process moves forward. Step 8. Your caseworker will help you navigate the waiting period and will thoroughly equip you with the knowledge you will need to proceed once you have been chosen by a birthmother. CCS believes that the best adoption experiences are always tailored to fit the needs of the adopted child first and foremost. Step 9. Depending on the type of adoptive placement the birthmother has chosen and with the agreement of the adoptive family, visitation prior to delivery may occur. Step 10. After a child has been placed with you, Covenant Care arranges monthly supervision of the adoptive placement until the Petition to Adopt is filed. Step 11. Finalization of the adoptive placement usually occurs within 2 months of the adoptive family’s attorney’s filing the Petition to Adopt. The entire adoption process after placement takes 4 to 6 months. Step 12. Covenant Care is continually available to all adoptive families seeking our services, before, during and after the placement of a child in their home. Our commitment to our adoptive families includes being available to them to help with issues related to parenting an adopted child."
